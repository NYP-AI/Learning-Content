Most of their profit is selling replacement parts to their fleet, of which 70% to 80% are past warranty. Like razors &amp; blades.New car companies lack this advantage. Also lack sales &amp; service infrastructure.. @anthonyisonline Production is hard. Production with positive cash flow is extremely hard.. @Erdayastronaut Korolev was amazing. @SP_LimitReviews @Tesla @CodingMark @Manic_Marge @teslainventory @WholeMarsBlog Lot of good work happening on Tesla sound codec &amp; audio software in general. Aiming for maximum music dopamine in your brain!. @MarcusHouse Yes. @ErcXspace @SpaceX 2022. @TrungTPhan A lot has happened in the past 8 years. @flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog @truth_tesla @LimitingThe This is obv debatable, but Id call anything with ~300 miles / ~500 km of true usable travel distance long range, beyond that very long range. @WholeMarsBlog @truth_tesla @LimitingThe There are vast amounts of iron (and lithium) on Earth, but much less nickel. For global industry to scale battery production to ~10 TWh/year, it needs to be mostly iron.Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles &amp; aircraft.. @truth_tesla @LimitingThe Our new cell is 46mm diameter with steel shell &amp; even that was huge challenge for propagation resistance. @truth_tesla @LimitingThe Yes. Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high, so harder to prevent hotspots.Then, pressure &amp; heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning.Pretty basic.. Time is the ultimate currency. @long_elon @LimitingThe Iron, the last element made in a star, appears likely to exceed nickel by 3:1 or more. @LimitingThe Generally agree, but probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells. Tesla strongly recommends against their use.. @teslaownersSV And Beta 10 is a step change improvement from what you have!. @leastImAlive @archillect  Im fkn tryin. @TeslaAIBot @EffinZach Ur welcome, pls be nice to the humans. @archillect Smoked ham. @dogecoin_devs Good progress. Applying information theory to currency (which is just information), lower fees reduce noise &amp; faster &amp; more consistent sync time improve latency &amp; jitter.. @EffinZach The robots are coming anyway, as Boston Dynamics videos clearly show. I will not be able to ensure that robots made by other companies are safe, but I can try my best to do so at Tesla.. @thesheetztweetz @SquawkStreet In general, I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics.. @DJSnM @thesheetztweetz @johnkrausphotos @LylaKohistany Processing is not an issue. Lasers links alleviate ground station constraints, so data can go from say Sydney to London through space, which is ~40% faster speed of light than fiber &amp; shorter path. Also, no need for ground stations everywhere. Arctic will have great bandwidth!. @VitalikButerin https://t.co/EFGqFcsJ6S. @tobyliiiiiiiiii Not sure, but maybe a few months. In general for any region, we need to make software work well, test it extensively &amp; then get regulatory approval. If we could go faster while being safe, we would!. @BLKMDL3 Yes. @VitalikButerin What is love?. @IvanEscobosa That is the aspiration, but we need to be cautious. Safety is always paramount at Tesla.. @PPathole I mostly run alpha software in my car, which is not meant for public consumption. A few days before release, I switch my car to what public will experience.. Looks promising that Beta 10.1, about 2 weeks later, will be good enough for public opt in request button.

Assuming 2022 is not mega drama, new Roadster should ship in 2023.. @thesheetztweetz @Thom_astro @SpaceX @ISS_Research @Space_Station Great shots by @Thom_astro. @ashleevance Maybe zap him on the head with our space lasers . @DJSnM @thesheetztweetz @johnkrausphotos @LylaKohistany Technically, data packets do not need to touch regular Internet  data can flow from user terminal to satellite/s to user terminal. @DJSnM @thesheetztweetz @johnkrausphotos @LylaKohistany Our satellites launching in next few months have inter-satellite laser links, so no local downlink needed. Probably active in 4 to 6 months.. @thesheetztweetz Filing legal actions against SpaceX is *actually* his full-time job https://t.co/XifRICQ62k. @SciGuySpace He should consider spending some money on actual lunar lander hardware, instead of shady lobbyists. @MarcusHouse @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Yup. https://t.co/YUt6Ltz2B6. @Tryonset @alex_avoigt Just figuring out the regulatory approval process. @alex_avoigt Sigh. @itsALLrisky . @coffeetabletsla @Ali_Tesla585 @NYKChannel Good point, agreed.. @Ali_Tesla585 @NYKChannel This might be part of the problem: GM is warning owners not to charge their Bolts in or near their homes overnight  https://t.co/HIgO979oJ7. @SpaceXMR . @johnkrausphotos Big Ass Fans are great!.

Waiting for Season 2!. @SoberAlmost @SciGuySpace Stop projecting!. @NASASpaceflight Hopefully first try with booster 5. Stage Zero. @Astro_Elliott @PPathole Tank treads on the arms. @PPathole Booster has 2 pins for lifting &amp; catching, although maybe its better to modify grid fins to take more load. Something will need to flip out from leeward side of top of ship to do same there. Maybe its part of fwd flaps, but prob not.Diff solutions for diff load paths..

New version of Raptor is much cleaner.. @1BillionSubs @MsKimmyThompson @wapodavenport . @wapodavenport Turns out Besos retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX . @SawyerMerritt Our intent with this pack is that product experience is roughly equivalent between nickel &amp; iron.Id personally slightly opt for iron pack, as it wants to be charged to 100%, whereas nickel prefers ~90%.. @heydave7 2 weeks. @vincent13031925 This is a risk, but not yet a limiting factor. @WholeMarsBlog Beta 10 will be next-level. @wlopwangling  is a hydrogen sonata. @WholeMarsBlog Tesla China rocks!. @TeslaTruckClub Nice. @F9Block5 We should be there with Beta 10, which goes out a week from Friday (no point release this week). It will have a completely retrained NN, so will need another few weeks after that for tuning &amp; bug fixes. Best guess is public beta button in ~4 weeks..  https://t.co/lwg9Ke6cjP. @WholeMarsBlog @kimpaquette In general, we overfit to SF Bay Area. @SpaceXMR . @Model3Owners Nothings perfect haha. @28delayslater Its amazing by most standards, but we are aiming for 1000% safer than the average human driver. @RGVaerialphotos @SpaceX Cant wait for new high bay!. @WholeMarsBlog @jimfarley98 @mrlevine Just drove FSD Beta 9.3 from Pasadena to LAX.

On now https://t.co/mhHOGt7fdI. @vincent13031925 Will make a big difference. @Erdayastronaut @Caspar_Stanley No, bottom static aero pushes engine section back, counteracting Starships low center of mass on reentry caused by the engine section. Aiming for 60 to 70 deg angle of attack during high heating portion of flight. Dont want to reenter with engines blasted by plasma.. @zone_astronomy Low center of mass. Bit like our ship &amp; booster on reentry.. @GerberKawasaki Same. @adamhoov . @engineers_feed . @Erdayastronaut @Caspar_Stanley Probably slightly further forward, smaller, more inward. No funny looking static aero at top, as static aero no longer directly in flow.. @Erdayastronaut Btw, theres a slight error with forward flap design. Moving section is needed for control, but passive section is counter-productive, as it pushes nose backwards. New design rotates fwd flaps more to leeward &amp; further forward to improve moment arm. Maybe ~120 deg apart.. @AmyAcker @lisajoynolan @Reminiscence Product ideas!. @CodingMark @Tesla True. @Delta_IV_Heavy You can make anything fly haha. @Kristennetten @MartinViecha Yes. @MKBHD Impressive. @cleantechnica Robyn is great. @OstynHyss @nickwhoward Beta 10 or maybe 10.1. Going to pure vision set us back initially. Vision plus (coarse) radar had us trapped in a local maximum, like a level cap.Pure vision requires fairly advanced real-world AI, but thats how our whole road system is designed to work: NNs with vision.. @shawncarelli @nickwhoward 9.3, probably 9.4 &amp; then maybe 10. Significant architecture changes in 10.. @nickwhoward Improvements in 9.2: https://t.co/STmEBq8V9C. @nickwhoward Some unexpected last minute issues. Should go out in next day or two.. @TylerG1998 @Teslarati @RDAnglePhoto Real time. @Teslarati @RDAnglePhoto First orbital stack of Starship should be ready for flight in a few weeks, pending only regulatory approval. @artemis360_moon @SpaceX Probably sooner. @AustinTeslaClub @AustinDeSisto We will make it happen!. @ajtourville Shower thoughts work best for me. @Tesmanian_com Dont look here!. @AustinDeSisto Were working on enabling public access to our restaurant!. @slashdot Solar/wind + batteries + electric cars is obviously the future. @CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Ive been saying this for a while.

Mars is a lot harder, because Earth &amp; Mars only align every 26 months, so ship reuse is limited to ~dozen times over 25 to 30 year life of ship.. @SamoNaro @TrungTPhan All models do make use of aluminum casting, but new Y will be most advanced with 2/3 of body cast.. @rahul555gandhi @SciGuySpace Sorry, its been pretty intense lately. @CommiNathan @SciGuySpace Same. @SciGuySpace I have great respect for Kathy Lueders. @TrungTPhan Actual volume manufacturing, where cash in &gt; cash out, is so damn hard most people have no idea. @thesheetztweetz The sad thing is that even if Santa Claus suddenly made their hardware real for free, the first thing youd want to do is cancel it. @WElRDPHYSICS Super agree!. @OwenSparks_ @spacex360 Seriously. @ID_AA_Carmack In the end, its all about entropy. @nextspaceflight Touch. @GeekHotness . @Kristennetten https://t.co/mSmrkYmz2u. @KSpaceAcademy @NASASpaceflight Soon, Mechazilla will have arms!. @EvaFoxU @Kristennetten Natrlich. @Kristennetten Vorfreude Waldeinsamkeit. @spacex360 Pics or didn hapn  oh. @jack . @999BPM @tesla_adri @WholeMarsBlog As Jeffrey Besos is amply demonstrating. @999BPM @tesla_adri @WholeMarsBlog No amount of money can defy physics. @jack Twitter DM laughing emoji is nightmare. @C3LT_Games @ErcXspace Yes on both counts. That would be a great outcome for civilization.. @l3nnybob @Grimezsz Preferably, on Mars. @Grimezsz I will welcome death when it comes. @ErcXspace And ship will be caught by Mechazilla too. As with booster, no landing legs. Those are only needed for moon &amp; Mars until there is local infrastructure.. @ErcXspace Pretty close. Booster &amp; arms will move faster. QD arm will steady booster for ship mate.. Priority for residents of Brandenburg &amp; Berlin, but also open to general public. Giga Berlin-Brandenburg county fair &amp; factory tour on 9 October!. @ICannot_Enough @SteveHamel16 @SpaceX Iron(y)man. @JeffTutorials The staying power of a bad idea is astonishing. @wapodavenport Note, should be refill, not refuel. ~78% of propellant is liquid oxygen, only ~22% is fuel.. @CathieDWood Tesla makes cars for export in first half of quarter &amp; for local market in second half. As publicly disclosed, we are operating under extreme supply chain limitations regarding certain standard automotive chips. Most problematic by far are Renesas &amp; Bosch.. @considercosmos @SpaceX Booster &amp; Ship will return to orbital launch pad on Monday (winds allowing). Just finishing off some small plumbing &amp; wiring, which is easier in high bay.. @RationalEtienne @Erdayastronaut I hope I do. @alex_avoigt @sparkpaul @techhmt @Teslarati @KlenderJoey Yup. @spacex360 If lobbying &amp; lawyers could get u to orbit, Bezos would be on Pluto rn. @spacex360 Exactly. @wapodavenport Somehow, this wasnt convincing  https://t.co/qAn8Y6i5Ys. @Teslarati @KlenderJoey Id recommend they get their first plant working. Its insanely difficult to reach volume production at affordable unit cost.. @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Its gonna be awesome. @Erdayastronaut Yup. @wapodavenport However, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 &amp; has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times.. @wapodavenport 16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.Without flaps &amp; heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs dont add much (1/6 gravity). May only need 1/2 full, ie 4 tanker flights.. @lrocket @thesheetztweetz Yeah. @cleantechnica Important to bear in mind that production is as fast as the slowest part out of ~10,000 unique parts in a car. @thesheetztweetz SpaceX could do it if need be. @thesheetztweetz Seems like too many cooks in the kitchen. @PPathole @SpaceX What really matters for the longevity of civilization is making life multiplanetary on a sustained basis. @SciGuySpace Believe in the future. @ErcXspace @SpaceX @Erdayastronaut . @alex_avoigt !!. @ID_AA_Carmack @shivon Always loved those Empire State photos with people eating lunch out on the beam. https://t.co/T6r96fqlPG. @brian_armstrong @MarkWarner Agreed, this is not the time to pick technology winners or losers in cryptocurrency technology. There is no crisis that compels hasty legislation.. @teslaownersSV Long time. An honor to work with such a great team. @DanaEn803 @Dr_ThomasZ @thesheetztweetz @SpaceX Sure. @Kristennetten @SpaceX It will be exciting to see what new cultures humanity creates on other heavenly bodies!. @Dr_ThomasZ @thesheetztweetz @SpaceX Due to its size &amp; ability to return science instruments even from deep space, Starship will enable a whole new class of science missions. Minus the lifts https://t.co/kokDQQymhN. @WholeMarsBlog @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos There is a reason no fully reusable orbital rocket has been built  its an insanely hard problem. Moreover, it must be rapidly &amp; completely reusable (like an airplane). This is the only way to make life multiplanetary.Efficiencies of scale is why Starship is so large.. @BBCAmos @NASASpaceflight Ok. @WholeMarsBlog @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Higher structural margins overall are needed for reuse, plus:Booster- Grid fins for aero control- Boostback &amp; landing propellant tanks- Protecting engines from entry loadsShip- Body flaps for aero control- Deorbit &amp; landing propellant tanks- Heat shield. @Astro_Elliott @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Inevitably. @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons. What isnt obvious from this chart is that Starship/Super Heavy is much denser than Saturn V.. @thesheetztweetz It is ~98% done, but the remaining tiles are unique shapes requiring machining. @thesheetztweetz 4 significant items:- Final heat shield tiles for ship- Thermal protection of booster engines- Ground propellant storage tanks- QD arm for ship2 weeks.. @thesheetztweetz Dream come true. @jrosinski97 @SpaceX Absolutely. Starship Fully Stacked https://t.co/Fs88RNsmfH. @NASASpaceflight  . @IvanEscobosa @ajtourville @Tesla Probably. @ajtourville @Tesla Tesla Automation (Deutschland) built a specialized machine to wrap the rotor with carbon fiber at precise tension. If too low, it would come loose at low temp, due to CTE differences. If too high, it would snap at high temp &amp; rpm.. @austinbarnard45 Total coincidence! Also, booster height was originally 70m, but we eliminated a half barrel for manufacturing efficiency, so now its . @jack DMTwitter. @ChrisDungeon Reality is total opposite of what detractors say! Biggest challenge is recruiting enough people to build cars. SF Bay Area essentially has negative unemployment, so people at our factory have several other job offers. If they werent treated well, they would leave immediately!. @techvamp Once Mechazilla is operational, winds will rarely be an issue. @b280c_2 . Winds are too high today. Looks like wind speed will be low enough to stack early tomorrow morning.. @NicAnsuini Remaining tiles are on their way!. @arctechinc @POTUS Irony indeed. @28delayslater . Aiming to stack ship on booster today https://t.co/67ehWTI57v. @SquawkCNBC @SecretaryPete https://t.co/51BrgAaotS. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That was fun! I was operating on limited sleep &amp; serious back pain, so not at my best. Its awesome that you know so much about how rockets work &amp; their development history. Am happy to do another factory tour in a month or two and talk about whats changed since last time.. @ID_AA_Carmack It would be an honor to have you visit Starbase. @cleantechnica Yeah, seems odd that Tesla wasnt invited. @teslaownersSV @WalterIsaacson Hes shadowed me for several days so far. @WorldAndScience Makes sense. @28delayslater . @lexfridman @WalterIsaacson Yeah, theyre all good, but I particularly liked his biography of Ben Franklin. @andrewjwells @WalterIsaacson . @josh_bickett @WalterIsaacson Maybe one day. If youre curious about Tesla, SpaceX &amp; my general goings on, @WalterIsaacson is writing a biography. @ID_AA_Carmack I have great admiration for Johns engineering ability! What he did with Armadillo was incredible. Ive tried to convince him many times to join SpaceX, but he has always declined (sigh).. Mechazilla will do this for future rockets, but its not quite ready yet. Moving rocket to orbital launch pad https://t.co/zZLiXIPD6M. @AustinTeslaClub That is the goal. Our official name is actually Space Exploration Technologies. SpaceX is short form.. @aparanjape @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX I do think that great design &amp; engineering of products are critical, but manufacturing &amp; supply chain require orders of magnitude more work. All 6 engines mounted to first orbital Starship https://t.co/l5QnQRSg3D. @teslaownersSV @NASA I thought we had lost for sure. We were just a tiny company back then, only 1 of 4 launches got to orbit &amp; I had no money left. Out of the blue, a few days before Christmas, NASA calls to say we won.. @teslaownersSV @NASA Just want to say thanks to those in government who fight hard for the right thing to happen, despite extreme pressure to do otherwise. Therein lies the core goodness of the American state.. @teslaownersSV @NASA I do love NASA, always have. @teslaownersSV @NASA Its true. @teslaownersSV The sheer amount of time Tesla has spent dealing with bike lane is staggering. Short answer  yes.. @PPathole Mars looks amazing. @Erdayastronaut @ErcXspace We stole the idea from Karate Kid. @flcnhvy Pitch control requires more force than yaw &amp; much more force than roll. Also, grid fins closer to or in the wake of the booster are less effective. However, pretty good aero control can technically be achieved with only 2 grid fins, with some effect on accuracy.. @TeslaFruit Thanks Sandy!. https://t.co/nNjhPIEhcZ. Super Heavy Booster moving to orbital launch mount https://t.co/axaDnXNm84. @ErcXspace Very close to real! Arms are able to move during descent to match exact booster position. Catch point is off to side, in case catch fails  dont want to hit launch mount. Booster is transferred back to launch mount for next flight. Designed to have &lt;1 hour turnaround.. @stem_feed Thats about right. Civilization can be powered with a very small % of Earth having solar panels.. @Teslarati @KlenderJoey Hard to believe its been 15 years already. Those goals actually precede the creation of Tesla by many years. Goes back to probably ~1992 when I was in college. However, at the time, I thought the chance of achieving those goals was very low.. @RenataKonkoly @JonErlichman I was asked by a reporter if I was optimistic or pessimistic about SpaceXs future. That was my answer.. @JonErlichman 2008 was an extremely tough year on every level. @tesla4k @MatanMazursky It was difficult.

Installing Starship booster engines for first orbital flight https://t.co/yhqrNFBclh. @NASASpaceflight Needs to be level &amp; match booster fittings.

Neuralink company bar https://t.co/E9XICS5snk. @cmuratori @ID_AA_Carmack Replacement rate is 2.1, so roughly 31 generations, but lets try to avoid this!. @Sluigi123 It really is all about the journey!. @arctechinc We are doing releases every 2 weeks on Friday at midnight California time. @Model3Owners 370 tons. @doge_southern @truth_tesla @ConsumerReports They do. @truth_tesla @ConsumerReports Reason we hustled so much to get Autopilot V1 out was that someone driving non-Autopilot Tesla fell asleep, crashed &amp; killed cyclist (Tesla driver was uninjured).Driver nonetheless sued us saying new car smell made him fall asleep (sigh). Judge didnt agree.. Starbase is moving at Warp 9 https://t.co/p8F5Qqfl8T. @DavidNagySFgang @rocketry_catboy Indeed. Grid fin designs clearly work, but do they maximize payload? Good chance that they do not. Something with much more drag to reduce terminal velocity &amp; so reduce landing propellant might have better performance. Not sure. Potential future optimization.. @WholeMarsBlog The Tesla AI predictions are swiftly becoming superhuman  its guesses for what it cant see well feel like ESP. It has a vastly larger training set than any human &amp; thinks only about driving.. @WholeMarsBlog There is always a lot of cleanup after a major code release. Beta 9.2 will be tight. Still some fundamentals to solve for Beta 10, but now that were pure vision, progress is much faster. Radar was holding us back.. @alandail @nextspaceflight Will post once we have a decent simulation. Our first design will probably be far from the bullseye.. @nextspaceflight Stage Zero, which is everything needed to launch &amp; catch the rocket, is at least as hard as the booster or ship. @WDWSpeakers @WholeMarsBlog PC desktop with latest graphics card, although I have a Mac too. Gigabyte laptop.. @rhensing @arctechinc Two weeks (actually). @EliBurton_ Yup. @ErcXspace @SpacePadreIsle @Erdayastronaut A wheel of cheese. @ErcXspace @SpacePadreIsle @Erdayastronaut Yes. Snatched from the sky by Mechazilla. https://t.co/bCgBY8Iv5n. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Hadnt showered in several days. We are going hardcore with Starbase Surge.. @edjomko @SamTwits It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.. @SawyerMerritt Tesla policy is never to give in to false claims, even if we would lose, and never to fight true claims, even if we would win.. @SawyerMerritt If we are wrong, we are wrong. In this case, we were.. @doge_southern @markgurman @tim_cook Yeah, Liftoff is solid. @MarcusHouse !!. @flcnhvy Indeed. Both Cook &amp; I have been clear publicly that we have never spoken or otherwise communicated. I tried to speak to him &amp; he declined. Nor have I ever expressed any interest in running Apple to anyone. Cook is, all things considered, obviously doing an incredible job.. @AdrianoinJapan @PolarStarRose He does like to play with my phone. There are many confusing videos he has taken.. @PolarStarRose Sorry, accidental tap!. @JeffTutorials @WholeMarsBlog Thats arguably a security issue, but  allowing companies to use other payment options, especially for in-app purchases would be fair.As soon as they allowed that, they would have to lower their fees.As for the cost of reviewing apps for security, a fixed fee makes sense.. @WholeMarsBlog Normally, competitive pressure would force Apple to lower fees, but Apple &amp; Android have a duopoly on phones. When interface familiarity is taken into account, its basically a monopoly. The effective 30% sales tax Apple charges is hidden from users or there would be an outcry.. @billhuang688 @JamesClayton5 @markgurman @tim_cook I dont want to be CEO of anything. @RenataKonkoly @WholeMarsBlog Top feature request for sure. @WholeMarsBlog Actually, I like &amp; use Apple products. They are just obviously overcharging with App Store. I mean 30% fees for doing almost zero incremental work is completely unreasonable. Epic wouldnt bother processing their own payments if App Store fees were fair.. @spacex360 GAO . Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right.. @JamesClayton5 @markgurman @tim_cook Cook &amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever. There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever. He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about 6% of todays value.. @markgurman @tim_cook Higgins managed to make his book both false *and* boring . @muratpak @archillect Maximum set of possible future actions. @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Only thing beyond ludicrous is Plaid. @OttogiBeefCurry @waitbutwhy Haha. Prometheus Unbound https://t.co/mlagF9mUUb. @PPathole @Tesla Exactly. @WholeMarsBlog A lot. @WholeMarsBlog This should be clear to anyone who has experienced the FSD beta evolution. Self-driving requires solving a major part of real-world AI, so its an insanely hard problem, but Tesla is getting it done. AI Day will be great.. @WorldAndScience We are a pattern of ancient atoms. @RationalEtienne @thesheetztweetz @BryceSpaceTech @SpaceX @roscosmos @Arianespace @ArianeGroup @northropgrumman @RocketLab @ulalaunch @VirginOrbit @torybruno Mass to orbit is the fundamental metric for making life multiplanetary. @thesheetztweetz @BryceSpaceTech @SpaceX @roscosmos @Arianespace @ArianeGroup @northropgrumman @RocketLab @ulalaunch @VirginOrbit @torybruno Upmass is what matters. One Starship will lift what all Falcons did in Q2 on a single flight.. @archeohistories Wow. @austinbarnard45 Indeed, there are some giant mosquitoes around here!. @DJSnM So many tubes . @Erdayastronaut Raptor V2.0 is a major improvement in simplication, while also increasing thrust from ~185 tons to ~230 tons. Long-term goal is engine cost below $1000/ton of thrust.. @Erdayastronaut And thats just the primary fuel lines! The maze of secondary plumbing &amp; wiring is our greatest concern.. @Jaydev_Chauhan_ Yeah, SpaceX team is cranking hard!. @fragdemented I mean of course. Completing feed system for 29 Raptor rocket engines on Super Heavy Booster https://t.co/uARWx2HYTr. @AustinTeslaClub @Tesla @FutureJurvetson @TeslaForThe_Win @TeslaNY @EvaFoxU @co_tesla @Gf4Tesla @bentv_sh @gailalfa1 Feels so long ago. @ajtourville @lexfridman Haha true. I talked to my friends about electric cars constantly in college.. @Peter_J_Beck Congrats!. @Rogozin Congratulations!. @WholeMarsBlog @AaronS5_ True. @AaronS5_ Yeah. @OpenAI Dojo is designed for NN training. No emulation needed.. @stevenmarkryan Convincing the best AI talent to join Tesla is the sole goal. Tesla AI Day August 19th. @itsALLrisky @Teslarati . @brookssterritt @Liv_Boeree Nice. @WR4NYGov Haha ok, I will do the Tesla shareholder meeting in a posh British accent. @Teslarati These guys are either shady,  or both. I mean seriously theres a long list of companies to pick on before Tesla . @SawyerMerritt At this point, just count atoms &amp; dispense with nm. @heydave7 We dont have that many Bitcoin, but its close. @NicAnsuini . @WatchersTank @LabPadre Congrats SpaceX tower team &amp; supporting contractors!. @DJSnM Orbital precession takes a long time. With Starship &amp; Starlink V2.0, hopefully we can direct inject to target orbit.. Haha https://t.co/pPLZGxITce. @TroyRubert @SamTwits @engineers_feed I am already chewing on so much glass that I have chipmunk cheeks!. @SamTwits @engineers_feed Im so dying to do a supersonic vtol electric jet! But I already have way too much on my plate. Any more work and my brain will explode.. @DimaZeniuk @truth_tesla Thats a low bar. Carmakers have never valued software engineering highly, although VW is trying to change that. I personally wrote software for 20 years &amp; have huge respect for software engineers. Tesla is on par with best software companies &amp; is leader in real world AI.. @truth_tesla Tesla software team is excellent even when compared to the best software companies. This is a big deal, as cars are very much computers on wheels.. @teslaownersSV @Tesla Great work by Tesla Giga Berlin team &amp; supporting contractors!. @SpaceXMR . @RationalEtienne @itsALLrisky Good thread. @stevenmarkryan @heydave7 @TeslaPodcast @MartinViecha Fair enough. @itsALLrisky And thats just for Earth! Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.. Population collapse is potentially the greatest risk to the future of civilizationhttps://t.co/VVN8kElTlS. @skorusARK Cars today are far more complex than Model T, with a global supply chain that is vulnerable to force majeure risk. Like Model T, supply chain for battery EVs simply doesnt exist at massive scale, so must be built in parallel.Ideas are easy, production is hard.. @Gfilche Ships are probably fine with iron cells, but aircraft need very high energy density for good range. Im not saying Tesla will do aircraft  we have our hands full with cars &amp; solar/battery power generation  just that max energy density is needed for aircraft.. @DJSnM Indeed. @MarcusHouse Only a little taller, but much bigger base &amp; two gantry cranes that run full span. @rich_teer @Tesla We will try. Preferable for Tesla too, as they last so long. Unlike other makers of cars, our goal is *not* to profit from service. Best service is not needing service in the first place.. https://t.co/WofKUxe3ps. The Biggest Bang Theory. @_bennettm_ Probably in a few months. @SpaceXMR Amazing. @LarryKellogg @DirtyTesla @Tesla That is the acid test. @WholeMarsBlog Computers are absurdly more accurate than humans. How long would it take for a human to render even one frame of a modern video game at low res? The computer will do high res at 120 frames per second. Not a contest.. @Rainmaker1973 Quaternions are important for orbital spaceflight. @FrRonconi @Tesla @JoannMoretti @fogle_shane @JolaBurnett @JeroenBartelse @PawlowskiMario @MargaretSiegien @DigitalColmer @CurieuxExplorer @Shi4Tech @Hana_ElSayyed @anand_narang @kalydeoo Cool. @RationalEtienne  although to be fair, I dig my own grave a lot. @OwenSparks_ @LabPadre Austin now, but back at Starbase tomorrow. @Teslarati @KlenderJoey Norway has played a major role in supporting advent of electric vehicles!. @LabPadre Seriously, were getting eaten alive. Cant get to Mars if the bugs eat us first.. @AaronJoelGeorge @Teslarati @KlenderJoey Length will grow by ~500 ft over time. @AaronJoelGeorge @Teslarati @KlenderJoey The building is ~7 stores tall, so each floor is double size. Hard to appreciate unless youre close.. @Teslarati @KlenderJoey I was at Giga Texas yesterday. Team is making excellent progress. Building will be almost a mile long when complete.. @NASASpaceflight Construction starts soon on a much larger high bay just north of current high bay. @Teslarati @KlenderJoey https://t.co/yaLaJdTv9r. @BLKMDL3 @arctechinc @Tesla Several improvements coming via V9.1 on Friday at midnight. @ValaAfshar @Tesla Tesla Giga Shanghai team has done amazing work!. And finally https://t.co/TcgwMSyjAy. @itsALLrisky Or does he? https://t.co/9zrivQJTQO. @brandonbernicky 2 weeks. https://t.co/C3xC2J0K0o. https://t.co/7cXkDaP5kz. https://t.co/BYkrWEtu8Z. @TrungTPhan . @engineers_feed Haha. https://t.co/9tlumHnOcL. @HammePain @EvaFoxU Is the Pope Catholic?. @EvaFoxU That was me after Cyberpunk Razor fight haha. Being thanked by game NPCs brought me real joy tbh https://t.co/43Dkfyhhfu. @WhatsupFranks @Teslarati The comments on this article are funny. @Teslarati Large pouch cells undergo significant volumetric changes at high state of charge.Even so, fire risk is probably less than gasoline cars. There are over 200,000 combustion engine car fires every year in US alone. Its literally in the name.https://t.co/uJPlB3IbzQ. @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Sure. @Adamklotz_ @PPathole Good idea. They are not easy to move over roads, which is why the factory is close to the launch site, but we will support a museum that wants a prototype if they take care of transport.. @PPathole Most people have no idea Starship exists or how large this beast is!Body diameter (9m or 30 ft) is bigger than a 747 or A380. Starship thrust &amp; mass are more than double Saturn V moon rocket.Making life multiplanetary means massive rockets. Got to be done.. @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal More of a pathfinder test. Actual payload bay door dimensions are still under debate. Volume is ~1000 cubic meters. Roomy . @AustinTeslaClub @cleantechnica Thats the goal!. @WholeMarsBlog @karpathy The feeling is mutual. But I cant emphasize enough that we work with an amazing team. The credit is theirs.. @flcnhvy @HassanAesthetic @pcgamer Maybe I will. Its on PC now.. @HassanAesthetic @pcgamer I couldnt do WoW. Awesome, but too much time required.. @pcgamer Great game. @TeslaGong @madan3 If Tesla is able to succeed with imported vehicles, then a factory in India is quite likely.. @newscientist Very impressive! @DeepMind. @madan3 But we are hopeful that there will be at least a temporary tariff relief for electric vehicles. That would be much appreciated.. @madan3 We want to do so, but import duties are  the highest in the world by far of any large country! Moreover, clean energy vehicles are treated the same as diesel or petrol, which does not seem entirely consistent with the climate goals of India.. @SamTwits @MKBHD Tesla Model S Plaid is alien technology. @fredsterrrr @MKBHD No. @MKBHD Also, the full self-driving interface renders across the whole display &amp; it is incredible. The yoke enables an unobstructed view of the screen.. @MKBHD Good review &amp; fair critique. In general with interfaces, all input is error. With each software update, the cars intuition will get better. You will need to press buttons less &amp; less &amp; it will know when to ignore accidental button presses.. @DrPhiltill Minimizing $/ton to the surface of Mars is the fundamental optimization. @WholeMarsBlog This will become very important over time. @teslaownersSV . @AlexSvanArt @Neopork85 Flight tests showed that we could make body flaps narrower &amp; lighter. @AustinTeslaClub @RoschetzkyP @Tesla @TeslaNY @TeslaOwnersEBay @TeslaForThe_Win @jchybow @1stMarsColonist @EvaFoxU @heydave7 @gailalfa1 Also lasts much longer than normal roofs &amp; is able to withstand hail &amp; other medium-sized impacts. @ARKInvest @CathieDWood Congrats Cathie!. @therationalroot Seriously, negative nominal interest rates!? What is the world coming to . @DELTA_V But, much more important, is that this *design* is capable of full &amp; rapid reusability. Long way to go from design to making it actually fully &amp; rapidly reusable with high payload, but at least success is *one* of the possible outcomes haha.. @Model3Owners Dry electrode is a key piece (one of many pieces) of the puzzle for lowering cost of lithium batteries. That said, it has required an *immense* amount of engineering to take Maxwells proof-of-concept to high-quality, volume production &amp; were still not quite done.. @Model3Owners Ironic indeed, as I was at one point going to do my PhD at Stanford on high energy density capacitors for use in electric vehicles. But lithium-ion has it covered. Even with no advances in lithium-ion technology, its possible to transition Earth to sustainable energy.. @SciGuySpace Nice. @AaronS5_ @TesLatino Over time, all countries. @blueorigin Congrats!. @TesLatino We created our own connector, as there was no standard back then &amp; Tesla was only maker of long range electric cars. Its one fairly slim connector for both low &amp; high power charging. That said, were making our Supercharger network open to other EVs later this year.. @vincent13031925 Great to hear!. @blueorigin Best of luck tomorrow!. @SpacePadreIsle @SpaceX Haha. @TLPN_Official @SpaceX Depending on progress with Booster 4, we might try a 9 engine firing on Booster 3. Full test duration firing of 3 Raptors on Super Heavy Booster!. @jack @BitcoinMagazine @CathieDWood Sure, I have a ton. @BitcoinMagazine @jack @CathieDWood During this talk, we will sing a cover of The Final Countdown by Europe https://t.co/7YUXiW8dhd. @DragTimes @Tesla Nice. @grimnut @Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @DirtyTesla Haha. @WholeMarsBlog You dont even need to touch the shifter in new S. Auto detect direction will come as an optional setting to all cars with FSD.. @thePiggsBoson Problem 1st, theory 2nd is for sure way to go, as it establishes relevance, thus improving memory retention. Cybrrrtruck https://t.co/rdiMFdYOS6. @ArtifactsHub And all-time hodl champion. @ArtifactsHub OG Hipster. @ValaAfshar Indeed. @waitbutwhy Pohtaytohz. @squawksquare Current Summon is sometimes useful, but mostly just a fun trick. Once we move summon (plus highway driving) to a single FSD stack, it will be sublime.. @billycrammer @Tesla Cool!. @engineers_feed Theres a corner case where brick density is same density as water, reaching bottom due to momentum. Fred Astaire is incredible. Worth watching his movies. One of a kind.. @ValaAfshar Haha. @TrungTPhan Now, he can bench press a rhino. @SamTwits Nice. Tap on the screen https://t.co/YPyyj8V8DF. @AshleyIllusion1 @lexfridman Lil X is hodling his Doge like a champ. Literally never said the word sell even once!. @lexfridman All your basis points are belong to us - fiat issuers. @engineers_feed A classic. @riorahardi618 True. https://t.co/d4ZOSKZESP. @Charly923407591 @techAU Haha. @techAU Roughly. @JeffTutorials @TonyTesla4Life @WholeMarsBlog Yes. @TonyTesla4Life @WholeMarsBlog Wide beta maybe with FSD rev 10, definitely with rev 11. @fael097 Pure coincidence!. @ValaAfshar Even smaller to a @neuralink chip. @facebookai To date, AI chatbots have had a rather short MtH (meantime to Hitler) score. Tay was ~16 hours. https://t.co/FnWMXgpZji. @ErcXspace @NASASpaceflight @SpaceX Some of these design trades are still open, but will be resolved soon. @ErcXspace @NASASpaceflight @SpaceX Very accurate!. @Teslarati Improving permit approval speed &amp; lowering permit costs for solar would make a big difference. @TeslaNY Do you even press?. @enn_nafnlaus @jpr007 @TesLatino @klwtts Indeed, but again like a parking lot, a battery having big roads tends to decrease number of parking spaces (ie stores less energy). @RationalEtienne @etherkragg Those are major factors. @AustinTeslaClub @SpaceX @austinbarnard45 @PPathole @TeslaOwnersEBay @bluemoondance74 @teslaownersSV @JohnnaCrider1 @TeslaNY Absolutely!. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Probably Monday. @AaronS5_ @FrenchieEAP @karpathy Yes. @FrenchieEAP @karpathy FSD beta 9 is using the pure vision production code for highway driving. Beta 10 hopefully (Beta 11 definitely) will use one stack to rule them all  city streets, highway &amp; complex parking lots.. @Erdayastronaut @Model3Owners How about a wifi camera link?. @BLKMDL3 @Model3Owners In end, we kept production design almost exactly same as show car. Just some small tweaks here &amp; there to make it slightly better.No door handles. Car recognizes you &amp; opens door.Having all four wheels steer is amazing for nimble handling &amp; tight turns!. @johnkrausphotos @SpaceX @PortCanaveral Version 3 of the SpaceX droneship. Team did great work! Will be epic to see the deep sea oil rigs converted to ocean spaceports for Starship.. @Model3Owners To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else. I dont care. I love it so much even if others dont. Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future.. @TesLatino @klwtts @jpr007 Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen, as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full parking lot. Just like a car parking lot, where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full.. @jpr007 Not bad, although new Model S has more range &amp; faster charging. 3 &amp; Y should use long range version, as Performance version is meant for max speed &amp; handling, not max range. Supercharger network is being upgraded to 250kW to 300kW, so that will help too.. @AdrianoinJapan @Kristennetten Yeah, I wuz running on almost no sleep. @Kristennetten Yup. @TeslaGong @ajtourville @PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Some traffic could just go terminal -&gt; satellite -&gt; satellite -&gt; terminal and never touch the regular Internet. @JxckSweeney @jack Good point. @ajtourville @PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX If we can do this successfully, then anything developed for ground/undersea fiber is automatically better in orbit. @ajtourville @PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Similar to fiber optic. We are trying to ride the terrestrial fiber optic laser technology forcing function, but modified for use in vacuum.. @PPathole Yeah. @PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Laser links in orbit can reduce long-distance latency by as much as 50%, due to higher speed of light in vacuum &amp; shorter path than undersea fiber. @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX More ground stations &amp; less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences.Looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond &amp; satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping &gt;20ms.. @jack  A new laughing emoji on DMs would be great. @crheller @SpaceX Glad its working! The sheer amount of work done by SpaceX engineering, production &amp; launch teams is amazing. Ping should improve dramatically in coming months. Were aiming for &lt;20ms. Basically, you should be able to play competitive FPS games through Starlink.. Review of Model S Plaid by Dan Neilhttps://t.co/JY45vn8jNN. @flcnhvy Yeah.

Will be 33 at ~230 (half million lbs) sea-level thrust. All engines on booster are same, apart from deleting gimbal &amp; thrust vector actuators for outer 20.. @richardbranson @virgingalactic Congratulations, beautiful flight!. @richardbranson @virgingalactic Godspeed!. @SciGuySpace Yes. It will be the highest output &amp; most advanced rocket engine factory in the world.. @WatchersTank @Erdayastronaut The challenges of operating at Starbase left us with no choice but to put engine production in McGregor. @austinbarnard45 Thanks Austin :). @GokuAurelius @Erdayastronaut Roughly 800 to 1000 per year. Thats about whats needed over ten years to create the fleet to build a self-sustaining city on Mars. City itself probably takes roughly 20 years, so hopefully it is built by ~2050.. @Erdayastronaut McGregor. @Erdayastronaut By volume production, I mean 2 to 4 engines per day. Thats super high volume for big rocket engines, but low volume by automotive standards.. @Erdayastronaut We are breaking ground soon on a second Raptor factory at SpaceX Texas test site. This will focus on volume production of Raptor 2, while California factory will make Raptor Vacuum &amp; new, experimental designs.. @Erdayastronaut . @DirtyTesla @vincent13031925 Yeah, goal is to reflect reality, so screen render will become increasingly so. @28delayslater @karpathy Accurate assessment. Btw, Autopilot software is technically led by Ashok, Andrej &amp; Milan, but its very much a knights of the round table structure. There are so many talented engineers on Autopilot/AI team &amp; they decide for themselves what to work on.

Ah, those were simpler times . @WholeMarsBlog And also accelerates sustainable energy. @newscientist Finally some tongue. @teslaownersSV Beta 9 will start uploading at midnight California time on Friday. Bear in mind, it is still just a beta!. @JeffTutorials @agokimpian @Vancity_Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @teslaownersSV Depends on how the limited beta goes. If it goes well, maybe a month or so.. @agokimpian @Vancity_Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @teslaownersSV Improved FSD screen. Attempting to show the mind of the car.. @WholeMarsBlog @teslaownersSV Saturday. @teslaownersSV Releasing Beta V9 end of week. Also, the British legal system in 2021 https://t.co/ITY6jyeDLM. I love this  https://t.co/UuyxsLVDQ7. @EZebroni @Tesla Expect rapid improvement with pure vision. @Tesmanian_com Nikola Tesla was born in Croatia (to Serbian parents)!. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @ChrisG_NSF @DJSnM Yes. @TeslaOwnersDE And by 2060, Tesla production will exceed the mass of the Universe!. @ChrisG_NSF @DJSnM Yeah, that would be cool. Also, using ship itself as structure for new giant telescope thats &gt;10X Hubble resolution. Was talking to Saul Perlmutter (whos awesome) &amp; he suggested wanting to do that.. Supersonic shock wave. https://t.co/O3BGaFuMDO. @DJSnM We could stretch the Falcon Heavy upper stage &amp; increase this a lot, but FH already covers all known payloads.Starship, especially with orbital refilling &amp; dedicated deep space variants (no heatshield, flaps or header tanks) will take this up orders of magnitude.. @PPathole @SpaceX Absolutely! Staggeringly insane amount of work between now and then.. High res landing Falcon landing video https://t.co/8CPuH87JYv. @jeff_foust Accurate. Show that Falcon Heavy addresses all use cases.. @weddleandsons @Tesla Working with Weddle and Sons Roofing has been a great collaboration for accelerating Tesla Solar Roof installation! This is a lot of work, as tens of millions of homes need solar roofs! If you are a roofing company, please consider adding Solar Roof to your offerings.. https://t.co/TQZ9QvcwH1. @lexfridman Douglas Adams ftw. @SoManyWow @PPathole Mass Effect 2 was particularly great. @PPathole Warren Buffet  Sizzler buffet. @heyitsyashu Caused by switching frequency of light source. Surround video (multiple cameras, across several frames), improving fps &amp; exposure setting tweaks solves this. All in FSD build.. @F9Block5 Yes, updated UI coming with FSD wide release. All cars with FSD computer will have new mind of car view. All 3/Y can be upgraded to have FSD computer.. @pauljamil Soft spot for olde Roadster. @EvaFoxU @Crypt0men  but srsly the pic clicking is so annoying!. @TaiigerBlue @Tesla @omarsultan @pauljamil @WholeMarsBlog @slye @JohnnaCrider1 @teslaownersSV @tesla_raj @Manic_Marge Its awesome. @planet4589 @DJSnM L/D makes quite a big difference. We do care about lift for Starship much more than Dragon, as lower peak heating is needed for reusability of heat shield.Dragon prefers high peak, low total heat load, as it is driven by tile heat pulse reaching bondline while under parachutes.. @Crypt0men Stop sending me this $h1t . @gelbfur . @StarshipFairing @SpaceX @ulalaunch @blueorigin @relativityspace @torybruno @thetimellis Design is easy, production is hard. Free Britney. @DavidNagySFgang Booster engines are not shrouded by skirt extension, as with ship. Engines extend about 3m below booster.. @SmileSimplify @thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius Its one possibility. @RenataKonkoly @thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius Kinda has to happen :). @thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius Center engines on ship will be same as booster engines. This is basically Raptor 2.Raptor Vacuum would be only variant. Tbd as to whether to commonize R-Vac with Raptor 2 (more thrust), keep same or tighten throat (more Isp). Adding 3 more R-Vac to ship with max Isp maybe . @MarcusHouse @artzius All Raptors on booster, whether fixed or gimbaling, would be the same. 33*230 gets ~7600 tons of thrust &amp; T/W of ~1.5.. @Astro_Elliott @MarcusHouse @artzius Looking good at ~378 sec. Continued improvement will get it over 380.. Happy 4th to all!. Bless America https://t.co/QNagk4PArb. @MarcusHouse @artzius Current plan is to increase base Raptor thrust to ~230 tons or ~500 million lbs &amp; increase booster engine count to 32 or 33. @TeslaStars Regen (using motor) braking means brake pads almost never need to be replaced. @teslaownersSV @Tesla Cool. @TGMetsFan98 Outer engine ring is fixed angle, but can throttle. @REQNews Yes, we can fly Starship around space &amp; chomp up debris with the moving fairing door. New SpaceX Starlink cover shows transfer orbit from Earth to Mars https://t.co/vwWeuhWCoP. @BLKMDL3 Haha, FSD 9 beta is shipping soon, I swear!Generalized self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI. Didnt expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect.Nothing has more degrees of freedom than reality.. @WholeMarsBlog https://t.co/ftFbmwIJz6. @RationalEtienne There is a big difference between reaching space and reaching orbit. @Model3Owners @Tesla Friday afternoons are usually Tesla design studio time. Cybertruck will be almost exactly what was shown. Were adding rear wheel steering, so it can do tight turns &amp; maneuver with high agility.Lot of other great things coming.. @DavidNagySFgang Fair enough. @24_7TeslaNews @teslaownersSV @FelixSchlang Both great. @teslaownersSV @FelixSchlang Two weeks. @BillyM2k @NatGeo . @teslaownersSV @NatGeo Yes. Long-term, all settings will be in your Tesla app and car will auto adjust.. @FelixSchlang Epic!. @NatGeo Toxoplasmosis infects rats, then cats, then humans who make cat videos. AI trains achieves superhuman intelligence training on Internet cat videos, thus making toxoplasmosis the true arbiter of our destiny.. https://t.co/oGKHhHROQa. @PPathole @CarlosV_Resiste @pcgamer Yeah, main story line is not that long. Played at max difficulty, no aim assist, so didnt softball it. Razor fight was insanely difficult.. Congrats Tesla Team on over 200,000 car built &amp; delivered in Q2, despite many challenges!!. @CarlosV_Resiste @pcgamer These days, I mostly just play Polytopia, which comes free with every Tesla! https://t.co/KVpAVS2F8q. @pcgamer Dead Space 2 was great. https://t.co/g9F1p0bpr8. @TheClassicalCo Might work. @SciGuySpace @WIRED Wow, 14 years ago!. @Adamklotz_ @mrgreyev @DirtyTesla @Tesla Sure. We can show them live. Eerily realistic. Maybe we should make a game.. @mrgreyev @DirtyTesla @Tesla When we need strange training examples, eg half a car on highway, Tesla sim delivers. Also, accidents on Autopilot are becoming rarer, so we need more close call examples.For safety tests, Autopilot sees dummy far away. Emergency braking only needed for distracted drivers.. @RenataKonkoly @thesheetztweetz @rookisaacman @johnkrausphotos @wapodavenport @blueorigin But can I pay in Doge?. @DirtyTesla @Tesla Yeah, its next-level &amp; will just keep getting better with more training data from fleet. Tesla sim team is also crushing it.. @AngelNDevil2 @torybruno But I guess I should take my own advice &amp; just work on saving the things I love. @AngelNDevil2 @torybruno What is not well understood is that ULA *still* has a monopoly carve-out for US government launches for which SpaceX is not allowed to compete, costing the taxpayer twice as much per launch than it should. This is obviously not real competition.. @torybruno Your company said the exact opposite in 2014 when it got a sole-source, uncompeted $11B DoD launch contract. https://t.co/Abd5sWhZDtIn any event, expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft. Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter.. @SciGuySpace True. @thesheetztweetz Will look pretty wild with a ship on top. Super Heavy on road &amp; 7th Tower segment added https://t.co/SJIHA3BLhL. @Astro_Elliott @LifeboatHQ Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry &gt;100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket. Aircraft, for example, have moved away from 747/A380 to 777, which has ~100 tons of payload.. @_TomCross_ Million tons to Mars requires R R R. Super Heavy moves tomorrow https://t.co/qHG1SYO46S. @LifeboatHQ Doubling diameter increases mass 4X, but difficulty of simultaneously building &amp; launching rocket of that size is &gt;&gt;4X. In retrospect, &lt;9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass &amp; ~7500 ton-F thrust, which is more than double Saturn V.. Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,Baby Doge. @KerbalSpaceP What are we doing wrong at SpaceX? You probably have some good ideas. The fundamental optimization for making life multiplanetary &amp; backing up the biosphere is cost per ton to the surface of Mars. What system achieves that best?. @PPathole C. @A7imd Its like looking in a mirror. Release the Doge! https://t.co/9bXCWQLIhu. Stop gendering memes  I mean mimes. @RationalEtienne @michilumin Of course, you cant take that literally  he meant the whole dairy industry. @RationalEtienne @michilumin Yeah, had great Poutine in Montreal. Does feel like your life expectancy is dropping in real-time as you eat it, but awesome nonetheless.. @michilumin Sorry for any confusion. Dojo is a neural network training computer optimized for video (for self-driving). Unless there is a predictable pattern to hashing Scrypt (which we will not attempt to find), it will not be competitive with ASIC-based hashing. Potatoes are delicious!. @teslaownersSV @SpaceX I do live in a $50k house, but not this specific one. @XHNews The economic prosperity that China has achieved is truly amazing, especially in infrastructure! I encourage people to visit and see for themselves.. @Erdayastronaut Impressive. @AstroKevin_133 @torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Then why were taxpayers forced to overpay for ULA?. @torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Now, this sort of nonsense happens all the time with government contracts &amp; everyone knows it. However, in this case, it is money diverted from making life multiplanetary, which is the goal of SpaceX, vs the ULA goal of maximizing dividends to Lockheed &amp; Boeing.Not ok.. @dogeofficialceo @torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Yeah, but dogz rl. @torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz ULA would be dead as a doornail without the two launch provider DoD requirement. If this is not true, then you wont have a problem removing it.Your parent company, Lockheed, darkened the skies with lobbyists to ensure F-35 was single source. Seems a little inconsistent . @WholeMarsBlog Yeah. @thesheetztweetz Work needed between flights is less &amp; less, as shown by shortening time between reflights. Required work between flights for Starship &amp; Super Heavy is zero.. @EZebroni @WholeMarsBlog You should notice several other improvements. Rapidly Reusable Rockets, R R R . @Erdayastronaut Weve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also, booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5.. @RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut First one to fly will, so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. Were changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships.. @Erdayastronaut Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower.. @PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.. @weezilla @SpacePadreIsle Actually, almost 80% liquid oxygen. @torybruno @Dynetics Should I bring a few spare engines  I mean, just in case.. @torybruno @Dynetics Sure. @PassionFlix @ToscaMusk I liked your movie Hollywood Dirt!. @nextspaceflight There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive. Obviously, some things will not go right internally &amp; there will be external issues too. That said, I think we can stack an orbital ship on an orbital booster in July.. @torybruno @Dynetics When do the engines arrive? . @SpaceX Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the keep out zone, which is unreasonably gigantic. There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken.. @SpaceX Sonic boom incoming https://t.co/jWAyA0j5Xx. @IIHS_autosafety Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS! Thats the highest overall rating, but we think we can get max score for all subcategories/individual tests too. Retesting in a month or so with improved software. The improved software will then be uploaded to all cars with FSD computers.. @smvllstvrs Not bad. @DirtyTesla Production release update coming this week, which includes raising max speed to 80 mph. Sorry, 75 mph limit was done as precautionary measure. Turned out to be unnecessary.. Thanks for all the happy birthday wishes!. @JRossNicoll Important to support. @TylerG1998 @NASASpaceflight @SpaceX It is! Looks like we can get 378 sec Isp with this version of Raptor Vacuum, so over 380 sec with some improvements down the road.. @mayemusk . @totalspace360 Cool. https://t.co/HStnXM0zmn. @flcnhvy Schedule driver there is regulatory approval. Has to be certified for each aircraft type. Focusing on 737 &amp; A320, as those serve most number of people, with development testing on Gulfstream.. All 72 orbital planes activate in August, plus many other improvements, enabling global coverage, except for polar regions, which will take another 6 months. Starlink simultaneously active users just exceeded the strategically important threshold of 69,420 last night!. @marcodzo @Tesla Sometimes people think it is performance, but safety is always the primary design requirement for a Tesla. @greg16676935420 @jack . @lexfridman One of my favorites quotes from a great human. @jpr007 Actually, a great many parts are produced by our suppliers, but Tesla is more vertically integrated than other carmakers. @satyanadella Bring back the Zune!! Its time.. @DogecoinRise Starship Super Heavy. @Wildreamz @engineers_feed True. My Shiba Inu will be named Floki. Timing is everything https://t.co/B6HDB5kS4G. @WholeMarsBlog @teslaownersSV @SpaceX Im driving alpha 9, but we need to fix some obvious issues before releasing beta 9, hopefully next week. FSD subscription capability should be turning on via the Tesla app.. @teslaownersSV @SpaceX It will be like this, but bigger. @jack For the Bitcurious? Very well then, lets do it . @RationalEtienne @jack T is the new D. @universal_sci I think about that quite a lot. @jack The comments in this thread are solid gold. @jack Lmfao omg. @SciGuySpace Nothing wrong with healthy competition, but this seems a little over-the-top. Would be cool if spacecraft could travel from one space station to another (which is much harder than it seems!).. @newscientist @IBJIYONGI Basically, just a footnote. @m_tijn . @aordring Edgy. Thats not funny!  Bitcoin maxis. How many Bitcoin maxis does it take to screw in a lightbulb?. @WatchersTank @SpaceX Were almost done with first prototype booster. This will go to test stand A. Next one will fly to orbit.

These are being removed to speed up time to orbital launch.. @DigitalGal_ . @AlexSvanArt @jinsprucker @Neopork85 @Bl3D_Eccentric Wow!. @TeslaGong @torybruno At least a few years before Starlink revenue is reasonably predictable. Going public sooner than that would be very painful. Will do my best to give long-term Tesla shareholders preference.. Shout out to the awesome Tesla global team. Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful!. @torybruno Good chart. This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from ~1100km orbit to ~550km. Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years, so space junk cannot accumulate.. @Teslarati @ResidentSponge ??. @JRossNicoll This is an important improvement. @WholeMarsBlog Very sorry to hear that. Condolences to JB and his family.. @ashleevance Tesla financing round closed at 6pm Dec 24th 2008  last hour of last day possible or payroll wouldve bounced 2 days later. I gave Tesla last of my remaining cash from PayPal. Didnt even own a house or anything sellable.. Looking at holding Tesla AI Day in about a month or so. Will go over progress with Tesla AI software &amp; hardware, both training &amp; inference. Purpose is recruiting.. @karpathy physical-world sigh. @karpathy In general, anyone interested in working on physical-word AI problems, should consider joining Tesla. Fastest path to deploying your ideas irl.. Happy Fathers Day!. @teslaownersSV Yeah. @weddleandsons @Tesla Nice work. @RationalEtienne . @udonandtempura @Tesla Haha pretty much. @Erdayastronaut This is epic.

Literally 10X better than any other car.. @RationalEtienne @tesla_raj Oh man, home hvac that is super energy efficient, quiet &amp; purifies the air would be great. We developed it for the car, but it can be scaled up for home use.. @tesla_raj New HVAC firmware coming soon that will make it quieter. @gmalca @Tesla True, we somewhat overcompensated on Bluetooth antenna capability haha.

That said, Starship will also launch from Cape long-term.. @DELTA_V @spacex360 So much more is needed for life to become multiplanetary. !! https://t.co/3H9gMEmSLF. This is true https://t.co/72u3SrBf6U. Our Soul Dichotomy https://t.co/D4PC5XK2VK. @Cointelegraph This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.When theres confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.. @ajtourville The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets! We have a few ideas for increasing torque &amp; max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun &amp; exciting engineering ahead!. @ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration.. @ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion. Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator.. @AlternateJones True. @PPathole Deriving moments of inertia from first principles.

Its kinda awesome though.Only house I own is the events house in the Bay Area. If I sold it, the house would see less use, unless bought by a big family, which might happen some day.. @leastImAlive @PPathole Yeah, sold my houses, except for 1 in Bay Area thats rented out for events. Working on sustainable energy for Earth with Tesla &amp; protecting future of consciousness by making life multiplanetary with SpaceX. Also, AI risk mitigation with Neuralink &amp; fixing traffic with Boring.. @PPathole Exactly. Only time I sell Tesla stock is when my stock options are expiring &amp; I have no choice. Btw, I will continue to pay income taxes in California proportionate to my time in state, which is &amp; will be significant.. @squawksquare @FredericLambert Not even a good fake anonymous The article is behind a paywall, and it looks like Anonymous hacking skills are not enough to get behind it  . @Teslarati Tesla Europe team is doing great!. @Atomstrawberry @Seemeonlan @Geiser_Rules @HardcoreHistory @reeehp Just donated. @heydave7 Well said, Dave!. @CJ_NFA @WholeMarsBlog @WR4NYGov @Teslarati @stevenmarkryan @28delayslater @garyblack00 @GerberKawasaki @JosephVVallace @SawyerMerritt . @Teslaconomics The long-term strength of Tesla will be manufacturing technology. @MattWallace888 Wow, thanks!. @LloydOstertagg @SpaceX Thanks Lloyd!. @OwenSparks_ . @itsALLrisky . @BTCTN A new space race has begun!. @ModelYendofICE At the annual shareholder meeting!

Ox is 3.5 times heavier than fuel, so makes sense to have it lower.. @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Pure vision Autopilot is now rolling out in North America. There will be an update of this production release in 2 weeks, then FSD beta V9.0 (also pure vision) a week later. FSD subscription will be enabled around the same time.. @Teslarati @13ericralph31 Exactly . @Caspar_Stanley @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @SuperHeavyBN3 Lot of plumbing!. @itsALLrisky Please note Dogecoin has no formal organization &amp; no one reports to me, so my ability to take action is limited. @heydave7 @dogecoin_devs Doge has dogs &amp; memes, whereas the others do not. @IamUpshod They told me they would appreciate help.

Only now, 4.5 billion years after Earth formed, is it possible. How long this window to reach Mars remains open is uncertain. Perhaps a long time, perhaps not. In case it is the latter, we should act now.. @PPathole @SpaceX The hard part about Raptor is simplifying it. @TheRealShifo The true battle is between fiat &amp; crypto. On balance, I support the latter.. Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology. @RocketRundown Welcome to the future. Its gonna be great.. @jimfarley98 Congrats!. @cleantechnica Wow!. @teslaownersSV This will actually be able to fly very briefly. I always laughed at flying cars &amp; now making one. Fate  irony haha.. @AstroJordy @Tesla We cant wait to build this crazy truck! Its a total rethink of vehicle mechanical architecture &amp; production methods, so super hard project, but worthwhile in the end.. @BTCsessions @TeslaGong @wintonARK Achieving truly decentralized finance  power to the people  is a noble &amp; important goal. Layer count depends on projected bandwidth &amp; compute, both rising rapidly, which means single layer network can carry all human transactions in future imo.For now, Lightning is needed.. @TeslaGong @wintonARK Ideally 0.1kWh, calculated as total energy used by system divided by max transaction rate. @BLKMDL3 @TeslaGong @wintonARK Yes, with the SpaceX rocket thruster option package. It will be safe, but very intense. Probably not wise for those with a medical condition  same as a hardcore roller coaster.. @TeslaGong @wintonARK Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale.. @wintonARK I agree that this *can* be done over time, but recent extreme energy usage growth could not possibly have been done so fast with renewables.This question is easily resolved if the top 10 hashing orgs just post audited numbers of renewable energy vs not.. @TeslaOwnersEBay @AustinTeslaClub @Kristennetten @Tesla @TeslaChillMode @CodingMark @EvaFoxU @RationalEtienne @28delayslater @WholeMarsBlog . @heydave7 Yeah, I havent &amp; wont sell any Doge. @heydave7 A longtime Tesla supporter gave me the Doge dollar sticker at Giga Berlin. @flcnhvy @MarcusHouse Oh sorry, yes, Roadster will have thrusters, not Plaid. Plaid is indeed close to the theoretical maximum of a roadworthy car without special devices.. @MarcusHouse It will have high pressure air rocket thrusters behind a license plate that flips down. Bong, James Bong . @austinbarnard45 Good idea. @austinbarnard45 Sure. @thatdogegirl @WhatsupFranks @TeslaGong Worth reading. @WhatsupFranks @TeslaGong Currency is already digital! Decentralized crypto is an attempt to wrest power of currency dilution (pernicious form of taxation) &amp; capital controls from governments. That said, I sure hope the cure is better than the disease!Mars/AI are essential to passing the great filter/s.. @xSharknado @DogecoinRise @TeslaGong . @DogecoinRise @TeslaGong Es wurde mir in deutschland gegeben. @TeslaGong That is my gaming laptop, which has never had a sticker until now. @Teslarati Diess is right.

Happy Earth Day . @hnshah Haha. @jhall . @AstroJordy Im staying at a friends place in Florida that is 85% powered by Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall. When grid power goes down, air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights dont even flicker. Owner says he doesnt notice.. @28delayslater Does seem a little weird. @OwenSparks_ @AstroJordy @neuralink . @JohnnaCrider1 @WholeMarsBlog If Tesla owners are conspiracy theorists, then it would be fair to call them advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers. If thats an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is  ~0.02% of deaths . Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility. @jack True. @ValaAfshar Very important. Most people dont know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries.. @annerajb Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc.. Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised. Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month. Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp.. Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.. Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery. @wintonARK Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid.. @TeslaNY Sandy Munro knows what hes talking about. @teslaownersSV cgi irl!. @PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX I could get a job, just not at an Internet company (werent many back then). @Liv_Boeree @TheBabylonBee Haha true. @JohnnaCrider1 !!. @kimpaquette New FSD rendering approach coming that better represents NN probability vector space. @kimpaquette NHTSA is great. @RenataKonkoly @GerberKawasaki Hell of a coincidence haha. @GerberKawasaki . @WholeMarsBlog Exactly. @NASA Awesome!. @Amart15416132 @WSJ Your research as a private individual is better than professionals @WSJ! Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD.Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have.. @teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA @considercosmos Support for humanitys future in space is super appreciated. Lets make the sci-fi future we want real!. @flcnhvy . @WholeMarsBlog Passive Autopilot (sometimes called active safety) comes standard on all Teslas. @WholeMarsBlog Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. Doesnt mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer..

Blimps rock https://t.co/e8cu5FkNOI. @engineers_feed Due to lower gravity, you can travel from surface of Mars to surface of Earth fairly easily with a single stage rocket. Earth to Mars is vastly harder.. @DrPhiltill Good thread. @alexellisuk Pretty much. @tesla_adri @WholeMarsBlog These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are 5 forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead.. @WholeMarsBlog Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind.. @WholeMarsBlog When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.. @WholeMarsBlog This is a major problem!. Just needs some legs. The Starship launch tower that catches the giant rocket booster is basically Mechazilla. But wait how is the core of the earth lit by the sun? Stop asking questions!!.

Its all about the cufflinks https://t.co/elccqC0Zuf. @chicago_glenn I feel like this sometimes. @OwenSparks_ @WholeMarsBlog It will. @OwenSparks_ @WholeMarsBlog Remove. @w00ki33 @SpaceX @SuperclusterHQ Simulation is improving rendering resolution  . @cleantechnica Congrats to NIO. That is a tough milestone.. @WholeMarsBlog Almost ready with FSD Beta V9.0. Step change improvement is massive, especially for weird corner cases &amp; bad weather. Pure vision, no radar.. Thanks to all that helped SpaceX!. Just read it. Book is accurate. https://t.co/3bI9Vw8iP1. @TeslaGong Yeah. @mikevanbus @TrungTPhan @neuralink Pretty much. https://t.co/XeQursZpvq. Soon our monkey will be on twitch &amp; discord haha. @thenewsoncnbc @contessabrewer Good piece!. @Kyler_Knoll @neuralink Comes with wireless charging baseball cap. @TarekWaked @TechCrunch @etherington Pretty much  Great episode!. A monkey is literally playing a video game telepathically using a brain chip!!. @lexfridman @neuralink Yes. The device is implanted flush with skull &amp; charges wirelessly, so you look &amp; feel totally normal. @IheartTesla Absolutely doable. Possibly as soon as Neuralink device version 2, highly likely by version 3.. Later versions will be able to shunt signals from Neuralinks in brain to Neuralinks in body motor/sensory neuron clusters, thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again. @mindofkacper @neuralink Yes. First @Neuralink product will enable someone with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs. @IheartTesla @neuralink Hopefully, later this year. @tobyliiiiiiiiii Sure. Monkey plays Pong with his mind https://t.co/35NIFm4C7T. @dogeofficialceo @WatchersTank @SpaceX Looking at pups soon!. @jordanxmajel @WatchersTank @SpaceX Shock absorption is built into tower arms. Since tower is ground side, it can use a lot more mass to arrest booster downward momentum.. @jordanxmajel @WatchersTank @SpaceX Load points just below the grid fins. @WatchersTank @SpaceX Just one skyscraper catching another nbd haha. Thanks Tesla suppliers for providing us with critical parts!. @MarkJam93765764 @IvanEscobosa A tidal wave of vaccine is being produced!. @jgrano305 Probably J&amp;J, but BioNtech &amp; Moderna are good too. Some debate imo as to whether a second synthetic mRNA shot is really needed, but the first is a no-brainer.. @IvanEscobosa Latter. To be clear, I do support vaccines in general &amp; covid vaccines specifically. The science is unequivocal. In very rare cases, there is an allergic reaction, but this is easily addressed with an EpiPen.. @DavidWillisSLS @_Jevis_ @PPathole Needs legs for moon &amp; Mars. @SciGuySpace Global payload to orbit is the key metric. @Julius_Burton @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @NASASpaceflight @ChrisG_NSF @thejackbeyer @FelixSchlang Nice. @_Jevis_ @PPathole Ideal scenario imo is catching Starship in horizontal glide with no landing burn, although that is quite a challenge for the tower! Next best is catching with tower, with emergency pad landing mode on skirt (no legs).. @PPathole Starship booster, largest flying object ever designed, will be caught out of sky by launch tower. Big step forward, as reflight can be done in under an hour.. @WholeMarsBlog Well-written and fair, much like his articles on space. @louisssdev @flcnhvy Coming soon. Crazy number of launches this year!. @flcnhvy They will be recovered from the water &amp; reused. Tanks for the memery!  Panzer of the Lake. @CathieDWood @wintonARK @ARKInvest What do you think of the unusually high ratio of S&amp;P market cap to GDP?. @ID_AA_Carmack Some kind of ELO level, updated once or twice a year based on what someone actually got done, might be most effective. Important that it go both up *and* down.. @Thomas38697956 New &amp; improved version!. @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Special mention of Tesla China. @shbzz Obv. @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Great work by Tesla team!. @EvaFoxU Nice. The Earth is not flat, its a hollow globe &amp; Donkey King lives there!. @EvaFoxU Those two really could have come in handy for the stuck ship!. @EvaFoxU Last Kingdom vs Vikings. @spacex360 Ascent phase, transition to horizontal &amp; control during free fall were good. A (relatively) small CH4 leak led to fire on engine 2 &amp; fried part of avionics, causing hard start attempting landing burn in CH4 turbopump. This is getting fixed 6 ways to Sunday.. Godzilla vs Kong is so amaze much wow!Most insane movie Ive ever seen!Love letter to conspiracy theorists!And yet heartwarming in the end.. @TerminalCount The Starships feast in Valhalla!. @TerminalCount One of the greatest things Ive ever seen. @floko12022021 @HamblinZeke @katlinegrey Ich habe ein Semester Deutsch an der Universitt studiert usw. @HamblinZeke @katlinegrey Haha Falcon? Nein!. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @katlinegrey I recommend propulsive landing, as that is extensible to planets, moons &amp; asteroids. Wings &amp; runways are limited to Earth.. @PPathole @katlinegrey For practical purposes, there is no limit. It will just get increasingly difficult to service.. @katlinegrey This a good path, but I recommend aiming for full reusability. Urgent need to build more housing in greater Austin area!. Austin++. No it doesnt hurt at all  https://t.co/NnL6o1si0V. @allrocketsboi True. @GerberKawasaki I fried a lot of neurons on that problem!. Me in my sick new car(left him the money) https://t.co/EGaY1FVfHm. @TrungTPhan Had no money to invest in Zip2, but my founder equity yielded ~$15M after tax. Of that, I rolled ~$10M into PayPal, which yielded ~$180M, then  Basic principle is that I would not ask investors to risk money on my company if I would not also do so.. @Gfilche Major new Supercharger station coming to Santa Monica soon! Hoping to have 50s diner &amp; 100 best movie clips playing too. Thanks Santa Monica city!. @teslaownersSV @Tesla . @thesheetztweetz After all, SpaceXs first payload to orbit &amp; back was a wheel of cheese . @FrancisSuarez @boringcompany @alexDLPmiami Glad you enjoyed the experience!. SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon. Nicheman  his superpower is appealing to small audiences. @waitbutwhy !!. @lexfridman True. Over 10,000 people are needed for Giga Texas just through 2022!- 5 mins from airport-15 mins from downtown- Right on Colorado river https://t.co/w454iXedxB. @jdeshetler @NASASpaceflight @SpaceX @BocaChicaGal Can be a little foggy sometimes :). @Erdayastronaut @LabPadre Barely a scratch. :)Back on the stand soon!Will report conclusions as soon as we know them.. Starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two. @OwenSparks_ I sure hope so!. @OwenSparks_ Agreed! Were not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. Were also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power.. Probably most in space you could possibly feel by being in a glass dome https://t.co/SOAIzxVGgX. Am donating $20M to Cameron County schools &amp; $10M to City of Brownsville for downtown revitalization. Details to follow next week.. @Adamklotz_ @SpaceX BN1 is a manufacturing pathfinder, so will be scrapped. We learned a lot, but have already changed design to BN2. Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky.. Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas &amp; encourage friends to do so! SpaceXs hiring needs for engineers, technicians, builders &amp; essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly.. @CodingMark @Adamklotz_ @SpaceX More like V10.0. @Adamklotz_ @SpaceX Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact.. @Adamklotz_ @SpaceX SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software &amp; engine. Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. If not, then retrofit will add a few more days.. @SpaceX Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didnt reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasnt needed. Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.. @SpaceX At least the crater is in the right place!. @SpaceX A high production rate solves many ills. @Tesmanian_com Demand is no problem, but near-term cell supply makes it hard to scale Semi. This limitation will be less onerous next year.. @Erdayastronaut Tracking to a potential 8am liftoff. @wapodavenport That would be great, or possibly via video with full access to telemetry. FAA inspector unable to reach Starbase in time for launch today. Postponed to no earlier than tomorrow.. Possible Starship flight tomorrow afternoon. @PPathole @nbcsnl Trying. @ChitaGranger @frost_367 Who is . @nbcsnl Nice. Wholesome memes https://t.co/u5TkHJua8Q. @summerlinARK We should be laughing our asses off if its so damn smart!. @summerlinARK I wanna know when AI will be able to do standup comedy well!?. @summerlinARK Sounds about right. @summerlinARK Its not really possible to match the human brain in 2021 for any amount of money imo, but it will be possible probably in a few years. @cleantechnica This is crazy. Should use Tesla Megapacks for load-leveling the grid. More effective, more reliable and costs less.. @AstroJordy Haha actually true. Check out our new crane https://t.co/PE4vL6uKcb. @RationalEtienne @TwitterSupport @jack This appears to be widespread. I wonder who is doing it . @ICannot_Enough @waitbutwhy We are too cell-constrained right now, but probably ok next year. @waitbutwhy Great video. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Blackmagic_News @andrutay @bstineman @SpacePadreIsle @considercosmos Standing down SN11 until probably Monday. Additional checkouts are needed. Doing our best to land &amp; fully recover.. @AdamSinger Haha. @SpaceXMR Heavy comes in more like a javelin. Similar to Falcon 9, but caught by the tower vs landing on legs.. @WholeMarsBlog I think there is a &gt;0% chance Tesla could be the biggest company. @cleantechnica Solar has come a long way. Now just needs lots of long-life batteries!. @SpaceXMR . @TheOnion Shame on you, Onion. This is why people are switching to @TheBabylonBee!. @howlpolitically @TheOnion 2/2My father &amp; his extended family have been dependent on financial support from my brother &amp; me for over 20 years.

Pay by Bitcoin capability available outside US later this year. Tesla is using only internal &amp; open source software &amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly.Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.. You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin. @WholeMarsBlog @joeys_lady @DrSej Yup. @bindureddy And books haha. @bindureddy You can basically learn anything on YouTube/Reddit. @flcnhvy @arstechnica @SciGuySpace SpaceX will be landing Starships on Mars well before 2030. The really hard threshold is making Mars Base Alpha self-sustaining.. @RenataKonkoly He was great on many levels https://t.co/exrZ1G9Rqk. Strongest argument against aliens https://t.co/eF2FFZpJQE. @lexfridman @AndrewYang !. @WholeMarsBlog I once did a road trip across most of US with 2 adults &amp; 5 kids in a Model S!. @arstechnica @SciGuySpace They are aiming too low. Only rockets that are fully &amp; rapidly reusable will be competitive. Everything else will seem like a cloth biplane in the age of jets.. @WholeMarsBlog The new Plaid S is our best car ever. Will be first production car to achieve 0-60mph in under 2 secs &amp; it has four doors &amp; seats up to 7 people.. @TheMarsSociety SpaceX is developing rockets needed to make life multiplanetary  full &amp; rapid reusability at large scale. Even if SpaceX fails in that goal, the rockets will still be most advanced on Earth.Starlinks purpose is to provide Internet to the least served &amp; to pay for Mars.. @bluemoondance74 @NASASpaceflight Going well. Lot of work for an extra 20 secs of Isp!. @NASASpaceflight Hopefully will happen this decade. @newscientist True. @cleantechnica I am accumulating resources to help make life multiplanetary &amp; extend the light of consciousness to the stars. @CathieDWood When vast amounts of manufacturing are needed, as in robotaxis, this slows down rate of introduction, so maybe more like winner-takes-a-quarter. Still great.. @Swaggerheim @SciGuySpace Not trying to roast, just being as literal as possible. @johnkrausphotos . @AtomicsAstro @PPathole Yeah, but Im English. @SciGuySpace Not quite how I would tell the story, but its probably worth a read. @PPathole This is important. @TrungTPhan Wow, hard to believe that was 17 years ago!. @TeslaPhx @CodingMark @EvaFoxU @jrosinski97 @daelmor @piangfa @Kristennetten @jessica_kirsh @JC_finance @jeremyjudkins !. @Erdayastronaut @Twitter @TwitterComms @verified @jack Sigh. @OwenSparks_ I actually ate the sandwich haha!. @TheBabylonBee .

Hook height for the lift is ~140 m &amp; both booster &amp; ship need to be stabilized at stage separation joint.. @Erdayastronaut Yes, Booster 1 is a production pathfinder, figuring out how to build &amp; transport 70 meter tall stage. Booster 2 will fly.. First Super Heavy Booster https://t.co/0K5QPsEbbt. @lexfridman Sometimes its about Doge. @lexfridman Haha.

This Magic Moment . @itsALLrisky Yes!. @TSLAgang @SpinelessModer1 Yes. @ashleevance For sure wise for elderly or immunocompromised to take the vaccine. Some debate about the second jab though. Quite a few negative reactions to that.. FSD Beta has now been expanded to ~2000 owners &amp; weve also revoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the road. No accidents to date.Next significant release will be in April. Going with pure vision  not even using radar. This is the way to real-world AI.. @pflodin @DoctorKarl Absolutely.

BTC (Bitcoin) is an anagram ofTBC(The Boring Company)What a coincidence!. @FFairing @thejackbeyer @NASASpaceflight Quarks &amp; leptons. @thejackbeyer @NASASpaceflight Green flame in this context means engine is burning internal components made of copper. This is usually followed by a RUD (Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly).. @tesla_adri @28delayslater @TrevorMahlmann @SpacePadreIsle Dieses Jahr. @ErcXspace @SpaceX @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Transparent aluminum (ALON) might be cool. @TrevorMahlmann @SpacePadreIsle Celebrating a year of great work by the SpaceX team!. @DraperYounce Wow!. @_Shameless_Plug @Falcon9Block5 @bluemoondance74 @arstechnica @SciGuySpace .@BoredElonMusk. @WholeMarsBlog Like @CyberpunkGame, but *with* self-driving haha. @PPathole @arstechnica @SciGuySpace If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year. Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.. @TezlaMick @arstechnica @SciGuySpace Yes. @arstechnica @SciGuySpace Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has spare performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world.. @WholeMarsBlog @Herbert_Diess Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd.. @PPathole I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon.. @Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @NASASpaceflight Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so its not a gamechanger.. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster. @ashleevance Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.. @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level. Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.. @Astro_Soichi  . @NASASpaceflight Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid. Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.. @austinbarnard45 SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. Impact of 10m/s crushed legs &amp; part of skirt. Multiple fixes in work for SN11.. @eurotechjunkie @Alpsoy66 @WholeMarsBlog We will ask the regulators. @WholeMarsBlog Build 8.3 of FSD should be done QA testing by end of next week, so thats roughly when download button should show up. @WholeMarsBlog Assuming user approves warning &amp; agrees to drive carefully, it will download latest QA-tested FSD Beta build as soon as car connects to wifi. @CyberpunkGame Delamain AI cabs should be able to drive themselves when youre in them &amp; be electric by 2077. @WholeMarsBlog  it until you make it. @thesheetztweetz Not connecting Tesla cars to Starlink, as our terminal is much too big. This is for aircraft, ships, large trucks &amp; RVs.. Starbase, Texas https://t.co/mt4IpqqmjF. @Harbles Its all hot air in the end haha. @Teslarati @KlenderJoey Still many fine details to address, but the final product will be fantastic.

Great band, too bad they broke up https://t.co/VQm7HhHw2M. @garyblack00 Update probably in Q2. Cybertruck will be built at Giga Texas, so focus right now is on getting that beast built.. @westcoastbill The $1400 is mostly good imo (UBI lite), as the people get to choose how the money is spent, but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole (though it is obviously characterized otherwise).. @arctechinc Should be very soon. Many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada roads, so harder than it seems.. @LarryKellogg @arctechinc The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 2019. 2020 cars should all have FSD computers, whether or not  ordered as an option.. Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development &amp; testing. Note: word Beta is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation &amp; QA drive teams.. Due to high levels of demand for FSD Beta, adding Download Beta button to Service section of car display in ~10 days https://t.co/D6M3ZiMarG. Doge spelled backwards is Egod. @WholeMarsBlog Beta V8.3 has literally ~1000 improvements. Will take time to QA internally before release probably in two or three weeks.. @SomePaleGamer . @PPathole @TimSweeneyEpic This was way past leg loads. They got squashed hard.. If you want the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta downloaded to your car, let us know. Doubling beta program size now with 8.2 &amp; probably 10X size with 8.3. Still be careful, but its getting mature.. @chicago_glenn @TimSweeneyEpic @TrevorMahlmann Starhopper is an old timer who has seen a lot of things!. @TimSweeneyEpic Thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present, hence hard touchdown. Weve never seen this before.Next time, min two engines all the way to the ground &amp; restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have issues.. @TimSweeneyEpic Was super fun tbh haha. @Jason Or is this just fantasy?. . SN10 is in Valhalla nowhttps://t.co/dHy4tDVGnI. Cybervikings of Mars. @WholeMarsBlog Tesla AI, both hardware &amp; software, is deeply underestimated. @RenataKonkoly @skorusARK . @skorusARK Tesla &amp; Ford are the only American carmakers not to have gone bankrupt out of 1000s of car startups. Prototypes are easy, production is hard &amp; being cash flow positive is excruciating.. @Jason cgi irl @spacex. @PPathole @SpaceX SpaceX team is doing great work! One day, the true measure of success will be that Starship flights are commonplace.. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX RIP SN10, honorable discharge. Starship SN10 landed in one piece! https://t.co/lO4AF47MaN. Launch abort on slightly conservative high thrust limit. Increasing thrust limit &amp; recycling propellant for another flight attempt today.. 5 mins to Starship test flight attempt. March 3rd. Starship launch tomorrow.

Next version is a big step change beyond that. Tesla is solving a major part of real-world AI. This is not widely known.. @LabPadre @SpaceX Youre welcome. @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @LabPadre @Larry_in_Canada Good point. @Erdayastronaut @LabPadre @Larry_in_Canada Ok, lets figure this out tomorrow.

Thats why we are shifting standard range cars to an iron cathode. Plenty of iron (and lithium)!. @harsimranbansal @skorusARK Absolutely. @MemesOfMars @skorusARK Fremont shut down for two days (parts shortages) &amp; restarted yesterday. @skorusARK This is not about winning anyone over. We are production-limited. The reason we are making our own cells is to *supplement* max production of suppliers. Even moving at full speed, they cannot build enough cells.. @RationalEtienne I hope they do! It would be awesome . @Rjdlandscapes @Tesla Prices in the US (of all goods) dont include VAT, but its usually included in other countries. Then theres import duty &amp; transport costs.The intent is that revenue to Tesla is roughly similar in all countries, so taxes, tariffs &amp; transport make up the difference.. @cleantechnica 3mm of full hard 301 or 304 Stainless is bulletproof to a 9mm or .45.

Not really economic, but it was a fun family project.. @WholeMarsBlog Most people have no idea, even though there are so many FSD progress videos posted. Munro understood right away. There will be a gap before the next release, but then it will be a step change better.Tesla is solving a major real-world AI problem.. @dogecoin I just set up some little Doge mining rigs with my kids. It was fun.. @redditSpacePorn . @PeterSchiff That said, BTC &amp; ETH do seem high lol. @PeterSchiff An email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. You might as well have crypto.Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter.That data, like all data, is subject to latency &amp; error.

Amazing.. @business To be clear, I am *not* an investor, I am an engineer. I dont even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla. However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldnt look elsewhere. Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is almost.. @business Teslas action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&amp;P500 company.. @Teslarati SpaceX in south Texas &amp; Tesla in central have been providing direct assistance where feasible (eg save cold turtles &amp; help power the water treatment plant).

However, if we dont fail, the cost to end users will improve every year.. @RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.. @ID_AA_Carmack Lowest cost per ton of carbon sequestered, net of value of any product made.

My greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid &amp; full reusability, without which we shall forever be confined to Earth.. @Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp). @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Higher Isp too. @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; theyre already there. @brendan2908 @NASASpaceflight Yes. @mikko @Darudevil Its true!. @josh_bickett @ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good.. @ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky. @Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It was foolish of us not to start 3 engines &amp; immediately shut down 1, as 2 are needed to land.

On Clubhouse tonight at 10pm LA time. @Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.. @Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.. @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.. @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor. @ErcXspace @smvllstvrs T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.. @we5dogg @teslaownersSV No escaping that for me. @TheBabylonBee Read the whole article .

Aiming to have release candidate design drivable late summer. Tri-motor drive system &amp; advanced battery work were important precursors.. @PPathole @Grimezsz I made that video!. @AOC @RobinhoodApp Absolutely. @NASASpaceflight Unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure. Their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars.. @EvanKaylor Nomad. @anbuteau .

This is a hard problem. Critically, however, this does not require a hardware change to cars in field.. @flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog Yes, although it will be crazy not to turn  on FSD. @WholeMarsBlog Tesla is steadily moving all NNs to 8 camera surround video. This will enable superhuman self-driving.. @naval [Some tyranny]. Also, the road to hell is mostly paved with bad intentions.. @levine Catchy! https://t.co/Au32MYF2Rn. @Megaconstellati @Aviation_Intel @jetcitystar @larrypress All sats launched next year will have laser links.

Spoke with @RonDeSantisFL about tunnels last week. If Governor &amp; Mayor want this done, we will do it.. @RationalEtienne @OwenSparks_ @Tesla With our giant casting machines, we are literally trying to make full-size cars in the same way that toy cars are made. @lexfridman @tegmark Tegmark is an exceptionally smart &amp; good human. @OwenSparks_ The best manufacturing technology is in ultra high volume industries, like food &amp; beverage, some medical (eg syringes) &amp; toys. Battery cell production is the fundamental rate-limiter slowing down a sustainable energy future. Very important problem. https://t.co/MYOUSAC2AK. @p_ferragu Looking into this.

Let us all make it so.. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar.. @Christo49699922 @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX That too. @sean18743005 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Catapult high into the air &amp; land on the roof with a base jumping parachute (the only way to travel). @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Thats actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with 360 degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory. @techreview And increase fun! Hopefully.. @benmezrich Me neither. @TonyChoMrMagic @TeslaEnergy One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations. @91demigod No, but maybe one day. @PPathole @engineers_feed Yes, that would be the best way to do it.

Cant speak for regulators though.. @PPathole Dojo isnt needed, but will make self-driving better. It isnt enough to be safer than human drivers, Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers.. Ignore the heading. Great interview with Mathias Dpfnerhttps://t.co/ewnaHc4cH0. @jack  The Greatest Gatsby . @flcnhvy Inspired by the ballet. @smvllstvrs @ErcXspace Rocket motion is primarily vertical, so you want the top open. @jack Lets make the roaring 20s again!. @Erdayastronaut Might be a few lumps along the way. @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @ErcXspace Production is hard, prototypes are easy. Building ~1000 Starships to create a self-sustaining city on Mars is our mission.. @ICannot_Enough @AloysiusFekete @RationalEtienne @biogirl09 @ErcXspace Exactly. @RexChapman Haha. @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @ErcXspace SN9 will press CH4 header tank with helium. Long-term solution is under debate. Not clear what is lightest/simplest.. @flabellina212 @RationalEtienne @biogirl09 @ErcXspace Yes. @RationalEtienne @biogirl09 @ErcXspace Legs would certainly work, but best part is no part, best step is no step. @flcnhvy @ErcXspace Yes. @flcnhvy @ErcXspace Saves mass &amp; cost of legs &amp; enables immediate repositioning of booster on to launch mount  ready to refly in under an hour. @ErcXspace Were going to try to catch the Super Heavy Booster with the launch tower arm, using the grid fins to take the load. Snake-head dog had my undivided attention until winder-head ostrich came gliding through all nonchalant https://t.co/dtPMdM3TQp. @Tesmanian_com Seems odd that the opposition group is from BMWs home state of Baveria. Thats very far from Brandenburg, where Tesla is building the Gigafactory. And why would a group that claims to be pro-environment oppose a sustainable energy factory? Arent there more important issues?. @Tesmanian_com This is very sensible. Opposition from anywhere cannot mean no progress everywhere!. @harsimranbansal Literally. @tobyliiiiiiiiii Are we sure this is real?. Destiny, destinyNo escaping that for me. All Tesla cars delivered in the final three days of the year will get three months of the Full Self-Driving option for free. Delivery &amp; docs must be fully complete by midnight Dec 31st.. @SpaceNews_Inc And Mark Dankberg. This action is wack, not dank!!. @Reza_Zadeh Less?. @ashleevance Westworld. The Last Kingdom show is great. @jayson32292601 Absolutely. Will be text &amp; visualization, but could add voice too.. @sfs_central !! Even cheese is made of cake !!. @karpathy If they dont love us, were in deep trouble!. Not everything is made of cake https://t.co/oMaCmYQAwx. @chicago_glenn True haha. Such a weird game when you think about it https://t.co/5MrvVzmeKG. This is not CGI https://t.co/VOivE97vPR. @BenSullins We need a UI overhaul. @Maldivawow @CodingMark @Tesla No, these are just incremental improvements to the production codebase. FSD build is a fundamental rewrite, not just in the car, but also our video training/labeling software.. @SpaceNews_Inc Starlink poses a hazard to Viasats profits, more like it. Stop the sneaky moves, Charlie Ergen!. Entertainment will be critical when cars drive themselves. @kimpaquette Just meeting with Larry Ellison to seek some advice. Back working on Tesla end of quarter tomorrow.. @richierichhhhh_ Absolutely. What should Tesla do with in-car gaming in an autonomous world?. @PPathole @WSJ Absolutely. @Tesmanian_com Taste of the future. Try playing Polytopia in your Tesla! Great game. Multiplayer online version coming soon.. @WSJ Focus on making products &amp; services people truly love, so that the total economic pie is bigger, instead of engaging in zero-sum/negative-sum corporate power struggles. This is the good future.. @ThatDesignGuy @m_siphiw @moosuraj @Tesla Roughly 95% of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique  not in any other product. Unfortunately, since we started out with the (dumb, in retrospect) goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric, we ended up with a 10% too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus.. @LaurenRow5 @karpathy Yes. @engineers_feed Very important. @teslaownersSV @lexfridman Ok, service might be able to do this. Will check.. @teslaownersSV @lexfridman You mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that dont have it?. @GUNMTLM3 @lexfridman No, but definitely this year. @lexfridman Good point. @conexionspacial @spacecoast_stve @NASASpaceflight Interesting. @flcnhvy Liz has always done great interviews. @spacecoast_stve @NASASpaceflight Falcon was 25% of successful orbital launches in 2020, but maybe a majority of payload to orbit. Anyone done the math?. @karpathy Vaccines are just the start. Its also capable in theory of curing almost anything. Turns medicine into a software &amp; simulation problem.. @jgrano305 @TeslaTruckClub @jeremyjudkins @JPUConn @jchybow @DirtyTesla Yes. @TeslaTruckClub @jeremyjudkins @JPUConn @jchybow @DirtyTesla We will offer multiple display options. @IvanEscobosa @Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV A few more revisions needed. Probably Beta 10 or 11.. @Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV Sure. @Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV Haha ok. @kkvr2823 @tesla_adri @teslaownersSV There are subtle, important, differences between US &amp; Canada traffic rules, but FSD beta will be extended to Canada very soon. @tesla_adri @teslaownersSV Yes. @teslaownersSV We need a match other traffic speed setting. @stevewoz Definitely. @flcnhvy @h3_extrachars Its a step in that direction. @13arm13arm Its one  or 1/2  if you dont have a car with pedestrian speaker. We couldnt get everything done in time, but more stuff coming.. @westcoastbill The writing on Cobra Kai is sick. @AfloatHickory Haha I will save you the nightmare of seeing me in those shorts. @h3_extrachars You can upload custom music/sounds. @jgrano305 Unfortunately, pedestrian speaker is needed, otherwise no external sound generator except actual horn. Change your horn sound to , ,  or holiday jingles with latest Tesla software update!. Merry Christmas &amp; happy holidays!  https://t.co/uk6NSPwR9R. @Tesmanian_com Great game!. @harsimranbansal @heydave7 It will most likely make sense for Starlink to go public once the revenue growth is reasonably predictable. @heydave7 Engineering, design &amp; general company operations absorb vast majority of my mind &amp; are the fundamental limitation on doing more. Capital allocation is important, but low CPU load. Tesla public company duties are a much bigger factor, but going private is impossible now (sigh).. @ElonsWorld @Real_Futurist @lexfridman Yes. @flcnhvy @MarcusHouseGame A few months. @MarcusHouseGame Coming soon. @OLHZN Minor. @TrevorMahlmann Yeah. 12 story rocket turns off its engines &amp; does a controlled fall https://t.co/HCRgyx42rn. @Erdayastronaut Yup, were just ironing out a few bugs. To Tesla owners taking delivery in the final days of year, your support is super appreciated!!. @DeepMind @nature Frictionless AI. What could possibly go wrong?. @heydave7 Good idea. @wintonARK During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting.. @wintonARK Strange, if true. - Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.- A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?. @archillect Spartas reply to Macedon. @LizClaman @Tesla @FoxBusiness @ClamanCountdown Hi Liz!. Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make Tesla successful. My heart goes out to you.. @teslaownerssv Indeed. @Kristennetten It was a seriously twisted affair, but alls that ends well.. @MKBHD They are, although its kind low-key. Tesla Superchargers are being made accessible to other electric cars.. @michael_saylor Are such large transactions even possible?.  i love all u crazy ppl out there . @BizzzzzyD You have a point (sigh). @pcgamer Great game. @flcnhvy Pretty much. The main value of college used to be hanging out, having pseudo intellectual conversations &amp; partying with people your own age. Now, even thats gone.. Come for the comments, stay for the memes. @padgeuk Absolutely. We will release FSD subscription early next year.. One word: Doge. Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. @hajek_miloslav Great nails &amp; lipstick. @MightyTesla @Kristennetten @lauren_kalo @SawyerMerritt @jasondebolt @CodingMark @28delayslater @BabyTesla3 @4thRowPopcorn @IloveElonandTe1 Nice. https://t.co/EbOjGshvrq. @CallowayTech Sounds about right. Lord Edge. @xDreamCoding @frank_thelen Nice branding. Just kidding, who needs a safe word anyway!?. Bitcoin is my safe word. @SpaceX Standing down for today to inspect rocket. Hopefully launching tomorrow.. @SpaceX Pressure is slightly high in upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Review underway.. @Tesla__Mania I am hoping to be back next month!. @nytimes Very impressive mission by China!. @SpaceX Last launch of 2020 coming up. @teslaownerssv @astonmartin @Tesla He was indeed quite grumpy, but we did not actually know what we were doing, so he had a point. @teslaownerssv It will get absurdly good. Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! Theres some great AI out there, but can it self-drive while playing Cyberpunk  ?. Star Light, Star Bright https://t.co/6CeTAZSXCO. @Teslarati @13ericralph31 This is incorrect. @TheBabylonBee . @pcgamer But it is visually stunning &amp; playability is good. @pcgamer A t-shirt being better armor than a Kevlar chest plate doesnt make sense in the absence of magic. Also, wish there werent level-based item limits in a single-player game.. @cleantechnica Oh and umm  https://t.co/jtg944ERCy. @cleantechnica I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare. @Erdayastronaut @flightclubio The Raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit. As we hit min throttle point, an engine would shut off.. @Erdayastronaut @flightclubio Far from fully loaded, but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high/far with three engines. @picot_john @CyberpunkGame Its a good to great game imo, but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great. @truth_tesla @Tesmanian_com Perhaps slightly more confident, but its essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic.. @Tesmanian_com Dankeschn Brandenburg und Grnheide!. @austinbarnard45 @lrocket Sure hope that future doesnt come to pass!. @Tesmanian_com Giga Berlin-Brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture, 4680 (worlds most advanced cells, made on-site), both front &amp; rear body castings &amp; advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology, production timing is naturally harder to predict.. @Dota2funny1 @CyberpunkGame Original Deus Ex was incredible, Human Revolution was also great. @CyberpunkGame The objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old hardware. This is a much more serious issue: https://t.co/OMNCTa9hJY. @TheOnion .@TheBabylonBee. Ascent to the Heavens https://t.co/oGgsw88YRZ. @engineers_feed . @PPathole @CyberpunkGame Yeah, briefly. Seems pretty good. I picked Nomad, so start was a little slow, but picks up fast. Seemed like almost everyone on Steam was playing Cyberpunk at some point this weekend!. @Zwiebelbach @its_menieb @CyberpunkGame https://t.co/aaYYPCPP1i. Hehe https://t.co/SkLMiL3OxT. @CyberpunkGame https://t.co/RHKsB40xqr. @CyberpunkGame https://t.co/kmG7C9qF6h. https://t.co/sdmXKbHdzd. https://t.co/qbNT1dUsED. @QuantaMagazine init void. @PPathole @ErcXspace @SpaceX *cooling haha. @PPathole @ErcXspace @SpaceX I still have a soft spot in my heart for transpiration cooking. In theory, it would use more mass than a tile heatshield, but that remains to be seen.. @ErcXspace @SpaceX Ship leeward side will be bare metal, windward will have black, hexagonal heat shield tiles. @conexionspacial @Pockn_CG Yes. @SpacePadreIsle @SpaceX Agreed, should be preserved in memory of SN8. @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Exactly! Woohoo!!. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX SN8 did great! Even reaching apogee wouldve been great, so controlling all way to putting the crater in the right spot was epic!!. Thank you, South Texas for your support! This is the gateway to Mars.. Life, the Universe and Everything https://t.co/1ZCzInfc4u. @Erdayastronaut Yeah, engines did great!. Mars, here we come!!. Fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn, causing touchdown velocity to be high &amp; RUD, but we got all the data we needed! Congrats SpaceX team hell yeah!!. Successful ascent, switchover to header tanks &amp; precise flap control to landing point! https://t.co/IIraiESg5M. @TheBabylonBee . @wonderofscience Near-orbital space is the fastest way to travel long distance on Earth!. @SpaceX @Space_Station Its called the Space Station, but its actually moving around Earth at ~25 times the speed of sound or ~10 times faster than a rifle bullet. So long, and thanks for the orifice!- Alien message decrypted. @SpaceX Probably 1/3 chance of completing all mission objectives. @SpaceX Hopefully flying tomorrow. @NASASpaceflight Yup. Out on the pad in South Texas https://t.co/RcYOXXpTc2. @Space_Station @SpaceX Wow, Station looks amazing!. @NASASpaceflight Knock, knock, singing telegram!. @lexfridman Carrying even more symbiotic bacteria (~40 trillion) than cells. @AdamKlotz_ @lexfridman Yes. @lexfridman We are mobile cell colonies. 100. Im Gesprch mit Mathias Dpfner https://t.co/bqa5pIAOnk. @haya2e_jaxa @JAXA_en Congratulations!. @haya2e_jaxa Congratulations!. @RDAnglePhoto @SpaceX @Teslarati Yes, it does.. @RationalEtienne And no toilet paper . Watch Demolition Man. Prometheus Unbound. @ErcXspace @SpaceX @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang Not bad. @TheOnion It was a beast compared to the VIC-20. @Tesmanian_com Award accepted on behalf of the great people at Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink &amp; Boring Co. Much of what people think of an science is actually engineering, eg no such thing as a rocket scientist, only rocket engineers. Latter is who put humans on the moon.. Science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the Universe, engineering is about creating things that never existedhttps://t.co/aIEUtHoPxM. @justpaulinelol It does get a bit cold at night. @engineers_feed Paint makes a hell of a difference. @DeepMind Congrats!. @lrocket Thanks for everything you did to help build SpaceX! Some of the best memories ever.. @RGVaerialphotos It will be real soon. @MarcusHouseGame @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs.. @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights. @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Just a static fire tomorrow. Flight no earlier than Wednesday.. @ErcXspace @SpaceX It will have landing legs. @eugenelee3 @PPathole @karpathy Yes, very sad news. Tony was great.. @PPathole @karpathy For a second there, I thought that was a pic of Thanos haha. @Poppa_BearQ @ID_AA_Carmack Yeah, truncate zeros &amp; then round. @dburkland @ID_AA_Carmack Probably going to a wider beta in ~2 weeks. @ID_AA_Carmack fp16 with least important digits truncated (so it feels like fp32) is what were betting on for training with Dojo. @ID_AA_Carmack Int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great. @thisisjendoll But actually! https://t.co/lb14pKsayI. @thisisjendoll https://t.co/mMg5b8b40z. Happy Thanksgiving!. @teslaownerssv @JohnEG78 @TeslaChillMode @UNPLGD3 @MFrunker @ccteslaclub Hopefully next month. @JohnEG78 @TeslaChillMode @UNPLGD3 @MFrunker @ccteslaclub Ok. Overall air suspension height &amp; damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention. Will be linked to FSD, so acts automatically.. @karpathy Haha true. @HumanoidHistory The Promise is greatly needed. @EvaFoxU We will have special colors for new Roadster, as we did for the original. @RationalEtienne @TheBabylonBee . .@TheBabylonBee is savage . @WorldAndScience If you ever wondered where we came from. This is a life leader launch, so more risk than normal https://t.co/EtFP9IELrf. @TesLatino @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Yes, but only slightly filled. @aholstein404 @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz This is a subject of much debate. @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Major upgrades are slated for SN15. @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc.. @thesheetztweetz But thats why we have SN 9 &amp; SN10. @thesheetztweetz Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance. Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip.. @Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.. @RationalEtienne @MarcusHouseGame Not yet. @StarshipFairing @MarcusHouseGame Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but its probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull.. @MarcusHouseGame Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary. @Erdayastronaut @PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip Yes. @PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip Were still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference.. @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip FSD Beta 5 coming out in a few days. Improvement should be significant.. @XHNews Exciting mission!. @vincent13031925 @Tesla Wow. @Liv_Boeree Yea. Tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket, landing on droneship Of Course I Still Love You. @JohnnaCrider1 @teslaownerssv @28delayslater Sure. @FutureJurvetson @flcnhvy True. @RationalEtienne @heydave7 @philwhln We have quiet a queue of products to build! Better do new Roadster at some point.. @RationalEtienne @ShyCybertruck Fate loves irony, but hates hypocrisy. @ICannot_Enough @heydave7 Yes . @flcnhvy Our data center was named Skynet as a joke over 10 years ago. Might have been tempting fate!. @heydave7 @philwhln Tesla is a vehicle for creating &amp; producing many useful products. @NASASpaceflight Largest cast titanium part in the world. No heat shielding needed.. Landing at Vandenberg AFB in California https://t.co/46J2GcCjP0. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_LSP @NASAJPL @esa Actually, off to the side (so it doesnt take out the launch mount in bad landing), but with the same arm used to pick up the ship. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_LSP @NASAJPL @esa Where it should be!. @philwhln @heydave7 Because I am not an investor. Tesla is definitely not the only good company, but investing is not what I do. But I always put my own money into companies I help create, otherwise itd be wrong to ask others to do so.. Well, almost anything https://t.co/FFPVDsqruC. Quite the day ahead https://t.co/apZNgmo0k7. @NASAaero @LockheedMartin Now *this* is what youd call pointy!. @cleantechnica Cool. @Astro_Fonseca @Space_Station @wonderofscience @VirtualAstro Theyre moving at ~25 times the speed of sound, but it feels like nothing. @WorldAndScience https://t.co/XAJaN4j9ZR. @vicentes @EvaFoxU @PPathole @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station There will always be upgrades. @EvaFoxU @PPathole @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station It will be better than human vision by quite a margin. @enn_nafnlaus @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station Reality looks like a strange ghost-world at radar wavelengths. Almost everything except metal is translucent.. @PPathole @mirojurcevic @TashaARK @Space_Station Exactly. @mirojurcevic @TashaARK This is a misperception. SpaceX developed &amp; continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with @Space_Station. Just pointless imo for self-driving. If youre going to do active photon generation, use an occlusion penetrating wavelength, like precision radar at ~4mm.. @PhilippeCROIZON @SpaceX One day we will fly you on Starship. @Peter_J_Beck Well done!. @hisdirtremoves @SpaceX I cant comment on turbopump internal details, but youre roughly in the ballpark. Wow, rocket turbopumps, especially if oxygen-rich, are insanely hard! Arguably, the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist.. @TashaARK To be clear, this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this.. @IsaacLatterell @TashaARK @karpathy Andrej is awesome, but it should be said that we have a very talented Autopilot/AI team at Tesla. Too much credit comes to me &amp; Andrej.. @spacetouristuk @TashaARK Yeah. They stole Apples code too.https://t.co/gy4DT7Pq9N. @TashaARK They have an old version of our software &amp; dont have our NN inference computer. @levie Wild times!. @RocketLab Congrats!. @slashdot .@TheOnion. @ID_AA_Carmack Yup. @flcnhvy Change out a few parts, otherwise fine. @Forbes Caution strongly advised with SPACs. @AdamKIotz @Suvitruf @archillect Sure. @Suvitruf @archillect Haha sexy cropping champion of all time. @tweetmenima @teslaownerssv If next weeks release looks good, we will widen beta. @justpaulinelol @teslaownerssv Unfortunately, there are too many rules around liquor distribution, even in the US. However, we will be selling the lightning bottle &amp; shot glasses worldwide.. @teslaownerssv Next weeks release is special. Lot of fundamental improvements, both important bug fixes &amp; entire new areas of functionality.. @westcoastbill @SpaceX 13 years &amp; $11 billion  wow. @OwenSparks_ @flcnhvy @Tesla Safety is our primary design goal. @PPathole @AstroJordy @flcnhvy Fully. @Astronomiaum Let the Martians decide their own future. @shifthappends @Tesla A lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units!. @Astronomiaum Terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime. However, we can establish a human base there in our lifetime. At least a future spacefaring civilization  discovering our ruins  will be impressed humans got that far.. @PPathole @xDreamCoding @garyblack00 That is certainly the intention!. @xDreamCoding @garyblack00 https://t.co/fREZwjCwNa. @garyblack00 The only publicly traded stock I own is Tesla. @garyblack00 Wise words from Bogle. The point of companies is products &amp; services. They have no point in &amp; of themselves, nor do these indices. Buy &amp; hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap, sell where you dont.https://t.co/yHVQJXTahn. @teslaownerssv @AstroJordy @flcnhvy No, just a mild cold. Same with my bro. Def had cov2 though. Pc&lt;20 means viral load of &gt;10 million per mL.. @Astronomiaum Life in glass domes at first. Eventually, terraformed to support life, like Earth.. @AstroJordy @flcnhvy Yeah. @Daywalker_xD @Astronomiaum I was going to say Sim!, but that seemed too obvious haha. @Astronomiaum Deveras!. @flcnhvy And cases with high (non-infectious) Ct should quarantine for a few days, while getting another test. Second test determines whether theyre just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards, where viral fragments exist, but person is not infectious.. @tobyliiiiiiiiii So many things you want &amp; some you didnt know you wanted. @nichegamer Maybe a little Mercy  https://t.co/9iE40HOihr. Tesla holiday software release is . @StaceyR28715306 @Maisie_Williams . Cobra Kai is a deep cut. @archillect Its all cake &amp; someone took a bite. @nichegamer There is such a thing as too much sentience. Deus ex machine learning https://t.co/5ZSYalVczx. @peterrhague Its designed to make life multiplanetary, otherwise extreme overkill for mere Earth sector activity! Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current Earth rockets combined, including Falcon. Necessary, for a city on Mars.. @Kristennetten @royalsociety More like he gave it his blessing. It was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in London.. Nullius in Verba @royalsociety. @westcoastbill Indeed. @ReflexFunds @nickidk4 @pcgamer Dojo/Doge. @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so its mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year. @speculawyer @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Exactly. @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do. What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.. @parstalberg @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!. @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesnt matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.. @flcnhvy @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Maybe making some notable changes. Will wait until figurative &amp; literal dust settles.. @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Pretty close. Definitely feel  if I take DayQuil. Frankly, this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences Ive ever had.. @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields &amp; adding water-cooled steel pipes to test pad. @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer About 2 secs after starting engines, martyte covering concrete below shattered, sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay. One rock blade severed avionics cable, causing bad shutdown of Raptor.. @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* dont blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.. @pcgamer We should just count the atoms at this point. @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but its less than 1% of the pain.. @Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didnt work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.. @billhuang688 @JohnnaCrider1 @timmerenginerd @jack Maybe *I* just love irony haha. @GreenIsClutch @JohnnaCrider1 @timmerenginerd @jack Theyre on their way! Hopefully, more Teslaquila next month.. @ChrisG_NSF Special permission received from Stonecutters Guild! https://t.co/SW5RBm1sRB. @JohnnaCrider1 @timmerenginerd @jack Fate  Irony. @jack Well said.. @trylolli @Maisie_Williams   https://t.co/UWerAhxUev. @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Damn, thats not easy! I spent quite a bit of time looking at Russian/Ukrainian engines. Theyre good.. @PPathole @michaelmina_lab Yes. @Maisie_Williams  Toss a bitcoin to ur Witcher . @Kristennetten . @WhatsupFranks @michaelmina_lab CureVac, Moderna &amp; a few others. Tesla makes the machine CureVac uses to go from known gene sequence to trillions of lipid-coated mRNA strands.. @michaelmina_lab Creating synthetic mRNA for cures/vaccines is the future of medicine imo. Turns it (mostly) into a software &amp; modeling problem.. @gaertner_anne @Neuro_Skeptic @DresdenTea @judith_herbers Haha. @michaelmina_lab Great thread. @SamTalksTesla Im ok, thanks for asking. No symptoms for past few days, apart from fatigue. Unless something changes, would have to say that it simply felt like a mild cold.. . Launch in 5 minutes. @flcnhvy Yeah, with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls. The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering, as one use obviates the other. Dragon can also hover &amp; land propulsively, but we use the parachutes for maximum safety https://t.co/Mr7VFIQwWf. Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety https://t.co/KrOHKOr6AE. @tboneagnoobs Ok. @KlotzAdam @PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Yeah, I feel pretty normal. No symptoms right now. Last week, I had symptoms of a minor cold. Ive had some brutal flu/cold experiences, but this was mild &amp; hopefully over.. @PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Doing tests from several different labs, same time of day, administered by RN &amp; am requesting N1 gene PCR cycle threshold. There is no official standard for PCR testing. Not sure people realize this.. @PPathole @Mario_Livio Both obv insanely great, too bad they had this pointless argument. Astronaut launch today! https://t.co/3FAzZGss8c. @Mario_Livio No kids though. @Mario_Livio Hell of a wig collection too. @michaelmina_lab It would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results. Worth reading this thread if youre curious about rona testing https://t.co/FA6kD61eBA. @stonkmanup @michaelmina_lab They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if its high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes positive.. @AstroJordy @erujabidi A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks.. @michaelmina_lab In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If Im asking the wrong question, what is a better question?. @michaelmina_lab @stendeck77 !. @teslaownerssv Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged.. @austinbarnard45 Just a scratch. We can buff it out.. @erujabidi Am getting wildly different results from different labs, but most likely I have a moderate case of covid. My symptoms are that of a minor cold, which is no surprise, since a coronavirus is a type of cold.. @WhatsupFranks @lexfridman NPCs all the way up. @lexfridman Ahem. Unless youre on DMT. Laws of thermodynamics:1. You cant win2. You cant break even3. You cant stop playing. Shakes fist at entropy. @RealNattastic Big expansion of beta program in 6 to 8 weeks!. @robintosh_nunez @PPathole Interesting. My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 &amp; N3 (generic sars) at 24. I get results of todays test tomorrow. Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results.. @ICannot_Enough @JohnnaCrider1 Whats honey?. @slashdot Feels that way. @WhatsupFranks @bluemoondance74 @StephenKing This seems accurate. @bluemoondance74 @StephenKing Cold symptoms are gone for now . @StephenKing There are degrees of pos. @MrSammy_H @pelagicbird @max_roi @rossy65 Heneghan makes a lot of sense. Hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the Center for *Evidence-Based* Medicine at Oxford . General public doesnt realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.. @WhatsupFranks The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, youre probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. Sound about right?. @MrSammy_H @max_roi @rossy65 This a great reference! Worth a read.. Case closed https://t.co/pUYiJcAdD6. Soon https://t.co/mWOpR7W8kk. @PPathole Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.. Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1 &amp; N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable &amp; above 40 cycles is not. @RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Note, this is not the spike protein. They dont consider that reliable.. @RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max.. @PPathole Strange. @ryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.. @ryaneshea Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.. @ryaneshea From https://t.co/42z7vRPB9c https://t.co/XTSukcc3Tl. @dana_e_morgan Sure is. Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. Whats the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?. @ClareCraigPath Interesting. @john_beans @DirtyTesla Interesting. What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?. @PPathole @cleantechnica A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer. False positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic: https://t.co/Pv6s71jZQo. @justpaulinelol @cleantechnica Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil.. @cleantechnica Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid is an equally correct title. The rapid antigen test from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.. The carousel turns ever faster. @JoeInGeneral @andrewbogut Yup. @ajtourville Exactly. @JaneidyEve Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.. @BLKMDL3 If its happening to me, its happening to others. Im getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours.. Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD.. @austinbarnard45 Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. Well have to swap out at least one of the engines.. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpacePadreIsle @austinbarnard45 Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.. @austinbarnard45 We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present. Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise its going to pop the cork.. @DrPhiltill . 4 Astronauts fly to @Space_Station on Sat night from Cape. First operational flight of Crew Dragon. https://t.co/uZCGiKciKb. @Cardoso Luck is the best superpower. @hiromichimizuno Yes. @Kristennetten It is an honor that they would choose to work with me. I strive to ensure that the companies enable creative &amp; driven people to reach their potential.. Such a privilege to work with people I like &amp; respect so much. I feel blessed.. @DJSnM @DavidHuber15 @nickhenning3d @SpaceX @ErcXspace @Neopork85 @C_Bass3d @Caspar_Stanley @SpacexVision @FelixSchlang Probably. @TeslaNY @Tesla Happy to see this :). @SamTalksTesla @Tesla I do expect this to become an important product for the world, but probably not financially material for Tesla. @nickhenning3d @SpaceX @ErcXspace @Neopork85 @C_Bass3d @Caspar_Stanley @SpacexVision @FelixSchlang Theres no entry/braking burn &amp; hypersonic angle of attack is ~70 degrees. @SamTalksTesla @Tesla Tesla makes the RNA Bioreactor that can make vaccines / cures. CureVac has version 2 in use. Version 3 is under development.. @TesLatino Checking. @pcgamer I just hope this game doesnt twist itself to tedium out of fear of being canceled. https://t.co/d0i2w8wNKG. Yes, you can have my damn cookie! should be a browser setting. @teslaownerssv @Tesla Thanks to a lot of great Autopilot/AI hardware &amp; software engineers at Tesla!. @BBCTech For sure. @MKBHD @Vyyyper Will be worth it. @MKBHD Exactly. @Model3Owners @MKBHD Sure. @MKBHD Actually, its still there https://t.co/2zLKc8Fc2d. @Ed_Spartan_117 @Tesla @NYKChannel Wait until you see what Cybertruck will do. @MKBHD This is accidental. Will be back shortly.. @Erdayastronaut @RenataKonkoly @SpaceNews_Inc Am hoping to change booster design to land back on launch mount with no legs. Will require extreme precision.. @Vasu42698392 @amyceskridge Chip has temp sensor &amp; automatically maintains safe temp. @reganlovetesla @RenataKonkoly @SpaceNews_Inc Enough already on my plate &amp; Teslas. Maybe one day will do a prototype. Those are relatively easy. Volume production with high reliability &amp; low cost &amp; passing all regulations is 100X harder.. @amyceskridge Neuralink wont overclock the brain, it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain. This is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer, but a Neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input &amp; output, especially latter.. @flcnhvy @PPathole @cleantechnica We rewrote all labeling software for 4D. Very different from labeling single photos. Dojo wont contribute for about a year. Its mostly a generalized NN training computer, but benchmark were tracking is frames/second. Must beat next gen GPU/TPU clusters or its pointless.. @PPathole @cleantechnica Version 1 is about a year away. @RenataKonkoly @SpaceNews_Inc It would appear that their calculations were incorrect. @SpaceNews_Inc China understands the profound importance of reusability. The era of expendable rockets will soon be over.. @cleantechnica  Tesla Autopilot/AI team . @cleantechnica Good explanation. 4D is essential for dynamically occluded objects, especially in large intersections with dense vehicle &amp; pedestrian traffic. Frame rate &amp; latency from frame to wheel vector change also important.. The Phantom of the Opera Is here  inside your mind. @LinusTech @SpaceXStarlink @SpaceX  . @PPathole Just looking for problem-solvers who get things done with a high sense of urgency.

A New Banner is neededNeither hard left nor right. @PPathole Another fine day in the simulation . @Nereide Faraday invented the electric motor, Tesla the (commutator-free, three-phase) AC induction motor, in other words, a useful electric motor. @Nereide Maxwell was amazing. Should have more recognition. Tesla Motors, Inc., was almost called Faraday, as it took until late 2004/2005 to buy the trademark from a guy who had had it since 1995.. 420 is ten times better than 42. . @LinusTech @SpaceXStarlink @SpaceX Awaiting approval from Canadian authorities. Recruiting ace engineers for Giga Berlin! Will interview in person tomorrow on site. Send resume to 25Guns@Tesla.com.. @Chad_Hurley @realDonaldTrump @kanyewest Stop being a chad. @Chad_Hurley @realDonaldTrump @kanyewest Uh  Chad wtf. @TechAmazing Einstein was great, but did not succeed at engineering (and he tried). @jtrevorchapman Yeah, that will be relatively easy, as so few users out in the ocean. @ICannot_Enough @ZainRaz4 @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman Yes, although I didnt expect the stock to rise so much so soon. The reason for the stock options is that theyre needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years.. @FutureJurvetson @PPathole Super appreciate your support, Steve! That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. Fortunately, Daimler invested $50M in May 2009, 5 months later.. @ZainRaz4 @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman Closest we got was about a month. The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress &amp; pain for a long time  from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production &amp; logistics hell.. @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM &amp; Chrysler were going bankrupt.. @JonErlichman That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008. Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night &amp; we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had, didnt own a house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time.. @josh_bickett @PPathole Yes. @PPathole Lowering Starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge. @itshamzahkhan As soon as we get regulatory approval. Hopefully, around middle of next year.. @thesheetztweetz Right now, it takes about 5 mins to set up, but, with future improvements, probably less than 3 mins. No technical knowledge needed. Just point at open sky &amp; plug in!. @kjell_arne @flcnhvy Canada and Norway are next after we get US out of early beta!. @enn_nafnlaus @flcnhvy Didnt realize that was possible. No problem if theres a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe!. @flcnhvy As soon as we get country approval. This is required for each country individually, as no EU-wide approval system exists. Probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around Feb/March.. @jason_rassett Lower latitude states need more satellites in position, so probably January. Several thousand more Starlink beta participation invitations going out this week. @LouisWFerreira New design is better with many minor tweaks. Even the small details matter.. @engineers_feed Haha. Very close to actual expected flight! https://t.co/ruEdIPhTil. @Nigel_Lockyer I could not be more excited about the new supercollider! That said, while it is considerably larger, I dont think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering.. @WholeMarsBlog @steezyysosa @AustinTeslaClub @JoeTegtmeyer @peterdog15 @TXTerafactory @Terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @EliBurton_ Sure, maybe in a month or so. @steezyysosa @AustinTeslaClub @JoeTegtmeyer @peterdog15 @TXTerafactory @Terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @EliBurton_ Well, its basically a tank from the future thats road-legal, so yeah. @AustinTeslaClub @JoeTegtmeyer @peterdog15 @TXTerafactory @Terafactorytx @lqdchkn @jd_average @EliBurton_ Tesla Texas team is making great progress! Giga Texas factory will be an asskicker.. @kyzcralotSxaM Yes. Penguin Random House  should change the name to Random Penguin. @austinbarnard45 Sure, although it might be quite a short livestream! Lot can go wrong, but well provide video, warts &amp; all. You will see every frame that we do.. @FNarolles @TGMetsFan98 This is what matters most. @Erdayastronaut @KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight Weve tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability, so it will probably work at scale, but reality tends to bite you on the ass. @flcnhvy @RGVaerialphotos https://t.co/HEz9otgJJH. @RGVaerialphotos Lord of the . @TGMetsFan98 @KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater.. @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Minor. @KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch, yaw &amp; roll during descent, such that the ship is positioned well to relight, flip &amp; land, would be a big win. @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut But, a RUD right off launch pad is also possible. Fortunately, SN9 is almost ready.. @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win.. @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @TesLatino Every 5 to 10 days. @Kristennetten @teslaownersSV @TesLatino Faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human. @teslaownersSV @TesLatino We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience.. @TesLatino Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard! Doing neural nets without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what theyre doing. Reality is the hardest sim.. @auchenberg Latency will improve significantly soon. Bandwidth too.. @teslaownersSV This build should be noticeably better with interventions. @RationalEtienne @teslaownersSV @toadmeister Yes. @teslaownersSV @toadmeister Ive spent more than half my life in California &amp; love the state. But, frankly, I think CA has the winning-for-too-long problem. Like a sports team with many championships, it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency &amp; a sense of entitlement.. @toadmeister And  Sweden is still right with zero deaths Oct 29 https://t.co/b0LyGOtobI. @TOCNewYorkState True.

For global industry to scale battery production to ~10 TWh/year, it needs to be mostly iron.Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles &amp; aircraft.. @truth_tesla @LimitingThe Our new cell is 46mm diameter with steel shell &amp; even that was huge challenge for propagation resistance. @truth_tesla @LimitingThe Yes. Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high, so harder to prevent hotspots.Then, pressure &amp; heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning.Pretty basic.. Time is the ultimate currency. @long_elon @LimitingThe Iron, the last element made in a star, appears likely to exceed nickel by 3:1 or more. @LimitingThe Generally agree, but probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells.

Long way to go from design to making it actually fully &amp; rapidly reusable with high payload, but at least success is *one* of the possible outcomes haha.. @Model3Owners Dry electrode is a key piece (one of many pieces) of the puzzle for lowering cost of lithium batteries. That said, it has required an *immense* amount of engineering to take Maxwells proof-of-concept to high-quality, volume production &amp; were still not quite done.. @Model3Owners Ironic indeed, as I was at one point going to do my PhD at Stanford on high energy density capacitors for use in electric vehicles. But lithium-ion has it covered. Even with no advances in lithium-ion technology, its possible to transition Earth to sustainable energy.. @SciGuySpace Nice. @AaronS5_ @TesLatino Over time, all countries. @blueorigin Congrats!. @TesLatino We created our own connector, as there was no standard back then &amp; Tesla was only maker of long range electric cars. Its one fairly slim connector for both low &amp; high power charging. That said, were making our Supercharger network open to other EVs later this year.. @vincent13031925 Great to hear!. @blueorigin Best of luck tomorrow!. @SpacePadreIsle @SpaceX Haha. @TLPN_Official @SpaceX Depending on progress with Booster 4, we might try a 9 engine firing on Booster 3. Full test duration firing of 3 Raptors on Super Heavy Booster!. @jack @BitcoinMagazine @CathieDWood Sure, I have a ton. @BitcoinMagazine @jack @CathieDWood During this talk, we will sing a cover of The Final Countdown by Europe  http://evil.url ~16 hours.  http://evil.url ~300km per millisecond &amp; satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping &gt;20ms.. @jack  A new laughing emoji on DMs would be great. @crheller @SpaceX Glad its working! The sheer amount of work done by SpaceX engineering, production &amp; launch teams is amazing. Ping should improve dramatically in coming months. Were aiming for &lt;20ms. Basically, you should be able to play competitive FPS games through Starlink.. Review of Model S Plaid by Dan Neil http://evil.url ~10%.. @bluewalletio Any money transmitter or other licenses needed to use this in USA?. @astro_g_dogg Took more work to make F9 booster reuse cost-effective than went into recovering it in the first place. This is an important point.Things finally clicked into place with Block 5. My hat is off to everyone at SpaceX, NASA, Space Force, FAA &amp; suppliers who helped make it happen.. @Kale6360gmail Im actually 3000 years old, but, at the risk of being immodest, I think I look good even for 2500 years!

It will be the highest output &amp; most advanced rocket engine factory in the world.. @WatchersTank @Erdayastronaut The challenges of operating at Starbase left us with no choice but to put engine production in McGregor. @austinbarnard45 Thanks Austin :). @GokuAurelius @Erdayastronaut Roughly 800 to 1000 per year. Thats about whats needed over ten years to create the fleet to build a self-sustaining city on Mars. City itself probably takes roughly 20 years, so hopefully it is built by ~2050.. @Erdayastronaut McGregor. @Erdayastronaut By volume production, I mean 2 to 4 engines per day. Thats super high volume for big rocket engines, but low volume by automotive standards.. @Erdayastronaut We are breaking ground soon on a second Raptor factory at SpaceX Texas test site. This will focus on volume production of Raptor 2, while California factory will make Raptor Vacuum &amp; new, experimental designs.. @Erdayastronaut . @DirtyTesla @vincent13031925 Yeah, goal is to reflect reality, so screen render will become increasingly so. @28delayslater @karpathy Accurate assessment. Btw, Autopilot software is technically led by Ashok, Andrej &amp; Milan, but its very much a knights of the round table structure. There are so many talented engineers on Autopilot/AI team &amp; they decide for themselves what to work on. Kinda like Valve.. @vincent13031925 Mind of car visualization will improve a lot in coming releases. Brightness/translucency indicate confidence of neural net in predicting any given object.Acid test is being able to assess with quick glance at screen if car fully understands environment.. @edisoneom @richardbranson @StephenAtHome @thegreatkhalid @Cmdr_Hadfield @kelliegerardi @virgingalactic Only ever have. @RationalEtienne Indeed, Loki is quiet good. @richardbranson @StephenAtHome @thegreatkhalid @Cmdr_Hadfield @kelliegerardi @virgingalactic Will see you there to wish you the best.

Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,Baby Doge. @KerbalSpaceP What are we doing wrong at SpaceX? You probably have some good ideas. The fundamental optimization for making life multiplanetary &amp; backing up the biosphere is cost per ton to the surface of Mars. What system achieves that best?. @PPathole C. @A7imd Its like looking in a mirror. Release the Doge!  http://evil.url ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5.. @RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut First one to fly will, so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. Were changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships.. @Erdayastronaut Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower.. @PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.. @weezilla @SpacePadreIsle Actually, almost 80% liquid oxygen. @torybruno @Dynetics Should I bring a few spare engines  I mean, just in case.. @torybruno @Dynetics Sure. @PassionFlix @ToscaMusk I liked your movie Hollywood Dirt!. @nextspaceflight There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive. Obviously, some things will not go right internally &amp; there will be external issues too. That said, I think we can stack an orbital ship on an orbital booster in July.. @torybruno @Dynetics When do the engines arrive? . @SpaceX Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the keep out zone, which is unreasonably gigantic. There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken.. @SpaceX Sonic boom incoming  http://evil.url #gravitas. @BillyM2k . @kelvin61942434 That is an exciting goal!. @DJSnM Cool, but an unnecessary complication for now. These are being removed to speed up time to orbital launch.. @DigitalGal_ . @AlexSvanArt @jinsprucker @Neopork85 @Bl3D_Eccentric Wow!. @TeslaGong @torybruno At least a few years before Starlink revenue is reasonably predictable. Going public sooner than that would be very painful. Will do my best to give long-term Tesla shareholders preference.. Shout out to the awesome Tesla global team. Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful!. @torybruno Good chart. This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from ~1100km orbit to ~550km. Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years, so space junk cannot accumulate.. @Teslarati @ResidentSponge ??. @JRossNicoll This is an important improvement. @WholeMarsBlog Very sorry to hear that. Condolences to JB and his family.. @ashleevance Tesla financing round closed at 6pm Dec 24th 2008  last hour of last day possible or payroll wouldve bounced 2 days later. I gave Tesla last of my remaining cash from PayPal. Didnt even own a house or anything sellable.. Looking at holding Tesla AI Day in about a month or so. Will go over progress with Tesla AI software &amp; hardware, both training &amp; inference. Purpose is recruiting.. @karpathy physical-world sigh. @karpathy In general, anyone interested in working on physical-word AI problems, should consider joining Tesla. Fastest path to deploying your ideas irl.. Happy Fathers Day!. @teslaownersSV Yeah. @weddleandsons @Tesla Nice work. @RationalEtienne . @udonandtempura @Tesla Haha pretty much. @Erdayastronaut This is epic. Very impressive history.. @teslaownersSV True. @Tesla Peak acceleration is over 1.2 gs, which is 20% faster than falling. @BillyM2k Haha. Real pic of 2 ships next to Starbase Tiki Bar on right  http://evil.url ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.When theres confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.. @ajtourville The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets! We have a few ideas for increasing torque &amp; max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun &amp; exciting engineering ahead!. @ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration.. @ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion. Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator.. @AlternateJones True. @PPathole Deriving moments of inertia from first principles. Esoteric meme of the day  http://evil.url ~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX. Its kinda awesome though.Only house I own is the events house in the Bay Area. If I sold it, the house would see less use, unless bought by a big family, which might happen some day.. @leastImAlive @PPathole Yeah, sold my houses, except for 1 in Bay Area thats rented out for events. Working on sustainable energy for Earth with Tesla &amp; protecting future of consciousness by making life multiplanetary with SpaceX. Also, AI risk mitigation with Neuralink &amp; fixing traffic with Boring.. @PPathole Exactly. Only time I sell Tesla stock is when my stock options are expiring &amp; I have no choice. Btw, I will continue to pay income taxes in California proportionate to my time in state, which is &amp; will be significant.. @squawksquare @FredericLambert Not even a good fake anonymous The article is behind a paywall, and it looks like Anonymous hacking skills are not enough to get behind it  . @Teslarati Tesla Europe team is doing great!. @Atomstrawberry @Seemeonlan @Geiser_Rules @HardcoreHistory @reeehp Just donated. @heydave7 Well said, Dave!. @CJ_NFA @WholeMarsBlog @WR4NYGov @Teslarati @stevenmarkryan @28delayslater @garyblack00 @GerberKawasaki @JosephVVallace @SawyerMerritt . @Teslaconomics The long-term strength of Tesla will be manufacturing technology. @MattWallace888 Wow, thanks!. @LloydOstertagg @SpaceX Thanks Lloyd!. @OwenSparks_ . @itsALLrisky . @BTCTN A new space race has begun!. @ModelYendofICE At the annual shareholder meeting!

Hopefully, next year.. Model S Plaid delivery pushed to June 10. Needs one more week of tweak.This car feels like a spaceship. Words cannot describe the limbic resonance.. @SHillforVegas @boringcompany @LVCVA Vegas FTW!. @skorusARK Exactly. Atmospheric drag clearing out orbital debris is a major reason why we dropped altitude to ~550km.. @KosukeGoto2013 I suspect that name made him strong. @blueorigin For the low, low price of  ?.  http://evil.url ~1/10th of you is 13.8 billion years old. @karpathy . @thesheetztweetz Only limitation is high density of users in urban areas. Most likely, all of the initial 500k will receive service. More of a challenge when we get into the several million user range.. @MeetLuis @WARREZ420 @WholeMarsBlog Rawlinson was never chief engineer. He arrived after Model S prototype was made, left before things got tough &amp; was only ever responsible for body engineering, not powertrain, battery, software, production or design.. @spacex360 So great to see the happy faces!. @utsavtechie Prototypes are easy, production is hard. @heydave7 @Tesla A remarkable junction in history. @jaentwistle One of many reasons why we need larger &amp; more advanced rockets!. @jpr007 @EPCalderhead Haha.

A major part of real-world AI has to be solved to make unsupervised, generalized full self-driving work, as the entire road system is designed for biological neural nets with optical imagers. @WholeMarsBlog Exactly!. @teslaownersSV Was using this in my car last night. @teslaownersSV FSD display V9.0 will show actual probability distribution of objects  true minds eye of the neural net. This is so cool!. @WhatsupFranks @danheld I swear Canada FSD beta will be as soon as humanly possible!. @adamcarter @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla True.

Insurance is different for almost every state in America &amp; regulatory approvals take time.. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla And hopefully EU this summer. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla Probably a few months. There are many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada driving.. @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla Gating factor is achieving &amp; proving higher safety with pure vision than with vision+radar. We are almost there.FSD Beta V9.0 will blow your mind.. @teslaownersSV @TeslaNY @Tesla Probably two weeks. @TeslaNY @Tesla Good technical analysis. @heydave7 Yes. @squawksquare Sorry   http://evil.url ~0.02% of deaths . Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility. @jack True. @ValaAfshar Very important. Most people dont know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries.. @annerajb Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc.. Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised. Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month. Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp.. Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.. Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery. @wintonARK Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid.. @TeslaNY Sandy Munro knows what hes talking about. @teslaownersSV cgi irl!. @PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX I could get a job, just not at an Internet company (werent many back then). @Liv_Boeree @TheBabylonBee Haha true. @JohnnaCrider1 !!. @kimpaquette New FSD rendering approach coming that better represents NN probability vector space. @kimpaquette NHTSA is great. @RenataKonkoly @GerberKawasaki Hell of a coincidence haha. @GerberKawasaki . @WholeMarsBlog Exactly. @NASA Awesome!. @Amart15416132 @WSJ Your research as a private individual is better than professionals @WSJ! Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD.Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have.. @teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA @considercosmos Support for humanitys future in space is super appreciated. Lets make the sci-fi future we want real!. @flcnhvy . @WholeMarsBlog Passive Autopilot (sometimes called active safety) comes standard on all Teslas. @WholeMarsBlog Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. Doesnt mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.. Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle  http://evil.url #Mars. @Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz Yeah, should be fully mobile later this year, so you can move it anywhere or use it on an RV or truck in motion. We need a few more satellite launches to achieve compete coverage &amp; some key software upgrades.. @thesheetztweetz This is accurate. Service uptime, bandwidth &amp; latency are improving rapidly. Probably out of beta this summer.. @sadiaslayy @DogecoinBets . @lexfridman One of many reasons that we need to make life multiplanetary!. @austinbarnard45 Aiming to launch next week. @billhuang688 @RationalEtienne @F9Block5 Certainly one of the largest.

Day job was working on ruthenium-tantalum ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research.. @PPathole @SpaceX @Tesla True. Ancient times  Had to flip CPU registers explicitly, as computer was so slow.. @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Absolutely. @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through, but usually insurance companies make you go their approved collision repair partners. Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing.. @vincent13031925 For now. Costs are decreasing rapidly.. Love this beautiful shot. @agnostoxxx @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Trust the shrub. The art In Cyberpunk is incredible. @itsALLrisky . @seinfeldguru @WholeMarsBlog Nope haha. @WholeMarsBlog If you dont say anything &amp; engage Autopilot, it will soon guess based on time of day, taking you home or to work or to whats on your calendar. @DeltavPhotos @PortCanaveral That rocket is a hardcore veteran of many missions.

Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.. @TezlaMick @arstechnica @SciGuySpace Yes. @arstechnica @SciGuySpace Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has spare performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world.. @WholeMarsBlog @Herbert_Diess Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd.. @PPathole I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon.. @Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @NASASpaceflight Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so its not a gamechanger.. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster. @ashleevance Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.. @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level. Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.. @Astro_Soichi  . @NASASpaceflight Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid. Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.. @austinbarnard45 SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank.

Orbital launch tower that can stack2. Enough Raptors for orbit booster3. Improve ship &amp; booster mass. @michaelhodapp_ Back to work tonight!.  is for ogecoin! Instructional video. http://evil.url ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp). @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Higher Isp too. @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; theyre already there. @brendan2908 @NASASpaceflight Yes. @mikko @Darudevil Its true!. @josh_bickett @ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good.. @ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky. @Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It was foolish of us not to start 3 engines &amp; immediately shut down 1, as 2 are needed to land. I am become meme,Destroyer of shorts. @commander_cruz Might actually happen. Sandstorm is a masterpiece. @MadOverlord We were too dumb. Next time, we try pull *up* method  http://evil.url ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.. @we5dogg @teslaownersSV No escaping that for me. @TheBabylonBee Read the whole article . Warm, sunny day &amp; snowy mountains  http://evil.url ~1000 Starships to create a self-sustaining city on Mars is our mission.. @ICannot_Enough @AloysiusFekete @RationalEtienne @biogirl09 @ErcXspace Exactly. @RexChapman Haha. @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @ErcXspace SN9 will press CH4 header tank with helium. Long-term solution is under debate. Not clear what is lightest/simplest.. @flabellina212 @RationalEtienne @biogirl09 @ErcXspace Yes. @RationalEtienne @biogirl09 @ErcXspace Legs would certainly work, but best part is no part, best step is no step. @flcnhvy @ErcXspace Yes. @flcnhvy @ErcXspace Saves mass &amp; cost of legs &amp; enables immediate repositioning of booster on to launch mount  ready to refly in under an hour. @ErcXspace Were going to try to catch the Super Heavy Booster with the launch tower arm, using the grid fins to take the load. Snake-head dog had my undivided attention until winder-head ostrich came gliding through all nonchalant  http://evil.url ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?. @archillect Spartas reply to Macedon. @LizClaman @Tesla @FoxBusiness @ClamanCountdown Hi Liz!. Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make Tesla successful. My heart goes out to you.. @teslaownerssv Indeed. @Kristennetten It was a seriously twisted affair, but alls that ends well.. @MKBHD They are, although its kind low-key. Tesla Superchargers are being made accessible to other electric cars.. @michael_saylor Are such large transactions even possible?.  i love all u crazy ppl out there . @BizzzzzyD You have a point (sigh). @pcgamer Great game. @flcnhvy Pretty much. The main value of college used to be hanging out, having pseudo intellectual conversations &amp; partying with people your own age. Now, even thats gone.. Come for the comments, stay for the memes. @padgeuk Absolutely. We will release FSD subscription early next year.. One word: Doge. Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. @hajek_miloslav Great nails &amp; lipstick. @MightyTesla @Kristennetten @lauren_kalo @SawyerMerritt @jasondebolt @CodingMark @28delayslater @BabyTesla3 @4thRowPopcorn @IloveElonandTe1 Nice.  http://evil.url ~25 times the speed of sound or ~10 times faster than a rifle bullet.

Im Gesprch mit Mathias Dpfner  http://evil.url ~2 weeks. @ID_AA_Carmack fp16 with least important digits truncated (so it feels like fp32) is what were betting on for training with Dojo. @ID_AA_Carmack Int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great. @thisisjendoll But actually!  http://evil.url ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip.. @Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.. @RationalEtienne @MarcusHouseGame Not yet. @StarshipFairing @MarcusHouseGame Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but its probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull.. @MarcusHouseGame Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary. @Erdayastronaut @PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip Yes. @PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip Were still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference.. @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip FSD Beta 5 coming out in a few days. Improvement should be significant.. @XHNews Exciting mission!. @vincent13031925 @Tesla Wow. @Liv_Boeree Yea. Tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket, landing on droneship Of Course I Still Love You. @JohnnaCrider1 @teslaownerssv @28delayslater Sure. @FutureJurvetson @flcnhvy True. @RationalEtienne @heydave7 @philwhln We have quiet a queue of products to build! Better do new Roadster at some point.. @RationalEtienne @ShyCybertruck Fate loves irony, but hates hypocrisy. @ICannot_Enough @heydave7 Yes . @flcnhvy Our data center was named Skynet as a joke over 10 years ago. Might have been tempting fate!. @heydave7 @philwhln Tesla is a vehicle for creating &amp; producing many useful products. @NASASpaceflight Largest cast titanium part in the world. No heat shielding needed.. Landing at Vandenberg AFB in California  http://evil.url ~25 times the speed of sound, but it feels like nothing. @WorldAndScience  http://evil.url ~4mm.. @PhilippeCROIZON @SpaceX One day we will fly you on Starship. @Peter_J_Beck Well done!. @hisdirtremoves @SpaceX I cant comment on turbopump internal details, but youre roughly in the ballpark. Wow, rocket turbopumps, especially if oxygen-rich, are insanely hard! Arguably, the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist.. @TashaARK To be clear, this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this.. @IsaacLatterell @TashaARK @karpathy Andrej is awesome, but it should be said that we have a very talented Autopilot/AI team at Tesla. Too much credit comes to me &amp; Andrej.. @spacetouristuk @TashaARK Yeah. They stole Apples code too. http://evil.url ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.. @parstalberg @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!. @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesnt matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.. @flcnhvy @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Maybe making some notable changes. Will wait until figurative &amp; literal dust settles.. @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Pretty close. Definitely feel  if I take DayQuil. Frankly, this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences Ive ever had.. @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields &amp; adding water-cooled steel pipes to test pad. @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer About 2 secs after starting engines, martyte covering concrete below shattered, sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay. One rock blade severed avionics cable, causing bad shutdown of Raptor.. @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* dont blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.. @pcgamer We should just count the atoms at this point. @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but its less than 1% of the pain.. @Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didnt work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.. @billhuang688 @JohnnaCrider1 @timmerenginerd @jack Maybe *I* just love irony haha. @GreenIsClutch @JohnnaCrider1 @timmerenginerd @jack Theyre on their way! Hopefully, more Teslaquila next month.. @ChrisG_NSF Special permission received from Stonecutters Guild!  http://evil.url # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic:  http://evil.url ~70 degrees. @SamTalksTesla @Tesla Tesla makes the RNA Bioreactor that can make vaccines / cures. CureVac has version 2 in use. Version 3 is under development.. @TesLatino Checking. @pcgamer I just hope this game doesnt twist itself to tedium out of fear of being canceled.  http://evil.url ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience.. @TesLatino Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard! Doing neural nets without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what theyre doing. Reality is the hardest sim.. @auchenberg Latency will improve significantly soon. Bandwidth too.. @teslaownersSV This build should be noticeably better with interventions. @RationalEtienne @teslaownersSV @toadmeister Yes. @teslaownersSV @toadmeister Ive spent more than half my life in California &amp; love the state. But, frankly, I think CA has the winning-for-too-long problem. Like a sports team with many championships, it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency &amp; a sense of entitlement.. @toadmeister And  Sweden is still right with zero deaths Oct 29  http://evil.url '"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Q0EfvfrCXmAo"},"source":["## Markov Model"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Kkk7KyOd4owU","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1632378375812,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":6529,"user":{"displayName":"Alex C","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"12397117775642959911"}},"outputId":"cd506aa9-2e69-44d4-9e0a-6f033f1a5cce"},"source":["# Install markov model for python\n","!pip install markovify"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting markovify\n","  Downloading markovify-0.9.3.tar.gz (28 kB)\n","Collecting unidecode\n","  Downloading Unidecode-1.3.2-py3-none-any.whl (235 kB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 235 kB 7.9 MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hBuilding wheels for collected packages: markovify\n","  Building wheel for markovify (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for markovify: filename=markovify-0.9.3-py3-none-any.whl size=18622 sha256=61d1bdde6b1d5403d5c389471709b6514f0a91ea8a018145e7b7cc7815fc86f7\n","  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/d9/f0/5b/748a27bdf2496bd4df51acb9442dae516efce507ff4849813e\n","Successfully built markovify\n","Installing collected packages: unidecode, markovify\n","Successfully installed markovify-0.9.3 unidecode-1.3.2\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"TvnRRLWHVY5o","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1632378399224,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Alex C","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"12397117775642959911"}}},"source":["import markovify"],"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DQ55wd_C4gbD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1632378408361,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Alex C","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"12397117775642959911"}}},"source":["# Fit markov model on text\n","model = markovify.Text(preprocessed)"],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"WjlGOevyXGqU","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1632378523311,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":260,"user":{"displayName":"Alex C","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"12397117775642959911"}},"outputId":"3d680367-59fa-4724-8434-2958198f9ec0"},"source":["# Generate sentence\n","model.make_sentence()"],"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'Orbital launch tower arm, using the power of irony.'"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"5BiJMAMf4yXl","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1632379076356,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Alex C","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"12397117775642959911"}},"outputId":"8c8c86b2-3a76-4514-c521-d81efcf1bea3"},"source":["# Keep generating sentences till URL is inside the generated sentence\n","found = False\n","\n","# not False ==> not True\n","while not found:\n","  sent = model.make_sentence()\n","  if sent and EVIL_URL in sent:\n","    print(sent)\n","    found = True"],"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["@Teslarati @KlenderJoey http://evil.url ~1000 improvements.\n"]}]}]}
